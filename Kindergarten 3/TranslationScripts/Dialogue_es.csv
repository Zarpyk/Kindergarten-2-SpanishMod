1,20,Player,,,I don't feel so good.,,
1,21,Nugget,Perhaps Nugget's friend cannot endure the goo like Nugget can. Perhaps Nugget's friend should see the nurse.,,,,
1,22,Player,,,That might be a good idea.,,
1,23,Nugget,The goo is not nasty! The goo would make excellent Nugget sauce!,,,,
1,24,Player,,,Fine. I'll try it.,,
1,25,Player,,,I'm not eating it.,,

1,33,Nugget,,,,,
1,34,Player,,,(Leave him to his goo.),,
1,35,Nugget,Nugget's friend is the same color as the goo. Perhaps Nugget's friend should seek medical attention.,,,,
1,36,Player,,,Good idea.,,

1,78,Player,,,Good for you Nugget.,,
1,79,Nugget,Oh my.<kgwait=1> Yes... Nugget's friend is too late. Nugget's friend should have eaten goo earlier so he had time to get help before the bell rang.,,,,
1,80,Player,,,I think I'm gonna-,,
1,81,Player,,,Smell this.,,
1,82,Nugget,A-<kgwait> A-<kgwait> A flower?!<kgwait> This flower... <kgwait>it is reminding Nugget of things. Of a time before the goo.,,,,

1,92,Nugget,But Nugget is covered in goo!<kgwait> Nugget does not wish to be covered in goo any longer!,,,,
1,93,Teacher,<wave>I understand that you're covered in goo and ick!<kgwait><br>But I won't let you inside because you don't seem sick!</wave>,,,,
1,94,Nugget,Surely the sing-song lady will let Nugget inside!,,,,
1,95,Teacher,<wave>Perhaps I could. Perhaps I may.<kgwait><br>I'll let you in if you'll star in a play!</wave>,,,,
1,96,Nugget,"Yes, Nugget will do anything to remove the goo. Now can Nugget please go inside?",,,,

1,100,Nugget,Nugget is growing frustrated.,,,,
1,101,Teacher,,,,,
1,102,Nugget,Nugget is growing increasingly frustrated with the sing-song teacher lady. Does Nugget's flower friend know any plays?,,,,
1,103,Player,,,I do.,,
1,104,Player,,,Nope.,,
1,105,Nugget,Aha!<kgwait> Nugget will pick one from this book!<kgwait> Nugget will do Romeo and Juliet!,,,,

1,110,Teacher,,,,,
1,111,Teacher,"<wave>I was going to put on the play, Little Red...<kgwait><br>But you would make a fantastic Romeo instead!</wave>",,,,
1,112,Player,,,Here.,,
1,113,Nugget,"This is a very peculiar Nugget of Friendship.<sup>TM</sup> It is green like goo and yet, not of goo at all.",,,,
1,114,Player,,,Do you want it?,,
1,115,Nugget,No. Nugget prefers his nuggets a cripsy brown color.,,,,
1,116,Player,,,Fair enough.,,
2,0,Player,,,,,
2,1,Cindy,I can't believe it. What an absolute idiot.,,,,
2,2,Player,,,What's got you so annoyed?,,
2,3,Player,,,Nope. Not getting involved.,,

2,5,Player,,,She wants to be your friend.,,

2,18,Cindy,Great! Lemme just get rid of these horrible vegetables for you so we can make room for some flowers!,,,,
2,20,Emmy,"Wait, no! That's not what I want you to-",,,,
2,21,Emmy,,,,,

2,28,Emmy,"You've ruined everything, you little flytrap! I'll never forgive you!",,,,
2,30,Cindy,"Yeah, yeah. Pipe down. So how do we get flowers growing in here?",,,,
2,32,Emmy,<size=100>WAAAAAAAHH!!</size>,,,,
2,34,Cindy,Wait!<kgwait=0.5> Come back!<kgwait=0.5> I need you to tell me how to make flowers!,,,,
2,36,Cindy,"Oh, forget it. What a waste of time.",,,,
2,37,Cindy,,,,,
2,40,Cindy,I can't believe I muddied my shoes just so Broccoli Becky can flake on me.,,,,
2,41,Player,,,Yeah. Unbelievable.,,
2,42,Player,,,Was the spit necessary?,,
2,43,Cindy,"Ummm... <kgwait=0.5>plants need water, don't they?",,,,
2,44,Player,,,I guess they do.,,
2,45,Cindy,Oh my gosh! Be still my beating heart!,,,,
2,46,Player,,,If only...,,
2,47,Cindy,Bite me. Anyway... <kgwait=0.5>did you see that? That boy just threw a rock at that stupid vegetable girl.,,,,
2,48,Player,,,I think it was an accident.,,
2,49,Cindy,It wasn't. Trust me. I've thrown a lot of rocks at girls in my day.,,,,
2,50,Player,,,Delightful.,,
2,51,Cindy,You should totally introduce me. I love a bad boy.,,,,
2,52,Player,,,Maybe.,,

2,55,Player,,,You'll be famous.,,
2,56,Player,,,You'll get flowers thrown at you.,,
2,57,Player,,,You'll get all the boys' attention.,,
2,59,Cindy,"I suppose I could get a jump start on becoming a celebrity. I wasn't going to star in my first major movie until I was six, but this could be a good stepping stone.",,,,
2,61,Cindy,You know I love my flowers. Fine.<kgwait> I'll be in your stupid play.,,,,
2,62,Cindy,"Not that I have a problem with that right now anyway, but a popularity boost couldn't hurt. Fine. I'll be in your stupid play.",,,,
2,63,Player,,,Break a leg.,,
2,64,Cindy,Haha. Not if I break yours first.,,,,
2,65,Player,,,It'll be a good career move.,,
2,66,Cindy,Fine. I'll be in your stupid play.,,,,
2,67,Player,,,(Walk away with my unbroken legs.),,
2,68,Cindy,I can't believe I'm gonna be famous already. This play better not suck.,,,,
2,69,Player,,,Here's hoping.,,
2,70,Cindy,Hey!<kgwait> What gives?!,,,,
2,71,Cindy,,,,,
2,72,Cindy,"I just don't get you, Greenhouse Gertrude.",,,,
2,73,Emmy,No. I don't think you do.,,,,
2,74,Cindy,"I've spat on, stomped, and stole everything you've cared about today!<kgwait> How can you still be trying to fix it? Just accept that I'm prettier than you!",,,,
2,75,Emmy,"Well, that's the thing about plants I don't think you get..",,,,
2,76,Emmy,Unless you get the root...,,,,
2,77,Emmy,<size=100>THEY TEND TO GROW BACK!!</size>,,,,
2,78,Emmy,,,,,
2,79,Cindy,,,,,
2,80,Cindy,*Hngh*<kgwait> All of this...<kgwait> you're still just an ugly gardener.,,,,
2,81,Cindy,,,,,
2,82,Cindy,Just...<kgwait> just..<kgwait> an-,,,,
2,83,Emmy,"I think we've heard enough out of you, Fertilizer Farrah.",,,,
2,84,Cindy,,,,,
2,85,Player,,,Wanna be Red Riding Hood?,,
2,86,Cindy,Wow. That's kinda messed up.,,,,
2,87,Player,,,It is?,,
2,88,Cindy,Yeah. My grandma was actually eaten by wolves. It was really messed up...,,,,
2,89,Player,,,"Oh, I'm sorr-",,
2,90,Cindy,How she cut me out of the will!<kgwait> I'm still mad that greedy old wench left me with nothing!,,,,
2,91,Player,,,So that's a 'no'?,,
2,92,Cindy,"Unless you know a really good estate attorney, yeah. It's a 'no.'",,,,
2,93,Player,,,Okay then.,,
2,94,Cindy,C'mon!<kgwait> My mom is always late picking me up anyway! Just have your fancy driver drop me off at home!,,,,
2,95,Felix,Absolutely not!<kgwait> Driverton is on strict orders to take me directly to and from this awful establishment and nothing more. Now get away from me.,,,,
2,96,Cindy,Killjoy!,,,,
2,97,Felix,He is shockingly late.<kgwait> Do you think the school actually informed our guardians of the early dismissal?,,,,
2,98,Cindy,"I've learned to expect less than the bare minimum of these schools, so I'm gonna say 'no.'",,,,
2,99,Felix,*Ugh*<kgwait> Not much more to do than wait I suppose.,,,,
2,100,Cindy,,,,,
2,101,Cindy,Wow!<kgwait> That was great!,,,,
2,102,Player,,,What was?,,
2,103,Player,,,I'm not interested.,,
2,104,Cindy,That girl getting hit in the face with the rock!<kgwait> Maybe this new school won't be as bad as the last one.,,,,
2,105,Player,,,Yeah... maybe.,,
3,0,Player,,,,,
3,1,Emmy,Hello! My name is Emmy! Welcome to my garden! Please watch your step. I don't want the vegetables to get hurt!,,,,
3,2,Player,,,This seems like a lot of work.,,
3,3,Player,,,(Leave her to her garden.),,
3,4,Emmy,"Oh goodness, it is! Some of the other girls and I used to take turns taking care of it, but most of them got pulled out after what happened yesterday.",,,,
3,5,Player,,,What happened yesterday?,,
3,6,Player,,,Do you want some help?,,
3,7,Player,,,It was nice meeting you.,,
3,8,Emmy,"Oh, that would be wonderful!<kgwait> But... <kgwait>um... <kgwait>it is a bit of a tradition around here for the girls to tend to the garden. Could you maybe introduce me to one of the girls from your other school?",,,,
3,9,Player,,,Sure.,,
3,10,Player,,,No thanks.,,
3,11,Emmy,So many crazy things! Apparently there's been a lot of kids going missing and two schools this week have been exposed for experimenting on them!,,,,
3,12,Player,,,That is crazy.,,
3,13,Emmy,"Yeah, I know! And now our principal has gone missing, a lot of the kids at this school got pulled out, you guys got sent here, and our old janitor is the substitute principal!",,,,
3,14,Emmy,"Oh, thank you! I can't wait to meet one of your friends! Just send her over here and I'll teach her how to take care of the garden!",,,,
3,15,Player,,,(Go find her a friend.),,
3,17,Emmy,,,,,
3,18,Player,,,What was the old principal like?,,
3,19,Player,,,What's the new principal like?,,
3,20,Emmy,"Oh, I always liked him. He was heartbroken when Alice went missing. I wish he was here to see that she's okay.",,,,
3,21,Player,,,Anything else?,,
3,22,Emmy,"No, not really. He was just a nice man. You could talk to Davey if you want to know more. He's the kid by the pond. The old principal was his dad.",,,,
3,23,Player,,,Thanks for the tip.,,
3,24,Emmy,I never really liked him. He's kind of a creep. Always skulking around and yelling at us for doing kid stuff. It's weird that he's in charge now.,,,,
3,25,Player,,,Why?,,
3,26,Emmy,Uh... <kgwait>cause he used to be the janitor?! I mean... <kgwait>shouldn't we have a vice principal or something?,,,,
3,27,Player,,,Oh yeah. What's up with that?,,
3,28,Emmy,"I know! Anyway, I would steer clear of him. He's a kid hater.",,,,
3,29,Emmy,"Oh, okay. Let me know if you change your mind.",,,,
3,30,Player,,,Will do.,,
3,35,Emmy,Have you found anyone yet? I could really use a feminine touch on these vegetables.,,,,
3,36,Player,,,Still looking.,,
3,43,Cindy,"Woah, those are some ugly plants. Almost as ugly as you, Eggplant Edna.",,,,
3,44,Emmy,"Oh yes, Doomed Donna. They can be quite ugly, but nothing compares to what you're about to be.",,,,
3,45,Cindy,Bring it on!<kgwait> I'm not afraid of some overgrown salad made by Hibiscus Hannah-,,,,
3,46,Emmy,,,,,
3,47,Cindy,OW!<kgwait> Stop!<kgwait> Jeez!<kgwait>,,,,
3,48,Emmy,"I'll call them off if you say you're sorry, Beat-up Brittney.",,,,
3,49,Emmy,,,,,
3,50,Cindy,Ouch!<kgwait> Okay! Fine!<kgwait> I'm sorry you're ugly and have a stupid hobby!,,,,
3,51,Emmy,"Wow, Stubborn Susan. That was not the apology I was looking for.",,,,
3,52,Cindy,,,,,
3,53,Emmy,"Thank you, my friends.<kgwait> Let her nourish you.",,,,
3,54,Emmy,,,,,
3,55,Emmy,"There. It's done.<kgwait> Goodbye, my friends.",,,,
3,56,PlayerCharacter,,,,,
3,57,Emmy,"Oh, wow! Would you look at that!",,,,
3,58,Emmy,,,,,
3,60,Emmy,"Oh, good!<kgwait> You're still here.",,,,
3,62,Player,,,That was a lot.,,
3,66,Player,,,What is it?,,
3,67,Emmy,It's a rare white flower!<kgwait> These are so hard to grow here. It's really good at combatting the effects of goo! The rabbits also hate them.,,,,
3,68,Player,,,That's neat.,,
3,69,Emmy,I want you to have it as a thank you for being so rosy to me today.,,,,
3,70,Player,,,Cool beans.,,
3,71,Emmy,Yeah!<kgwait> Beans are cool!,,,,
3,72,Player,,,That's not what I-,,
3,73,Emmy,See you tomorrow!,,,,
3,74,Player,,,"Bye, Emmy.",,
3,75,Emmy,Yeah. Do you think I took it too far?,,,,
3,76,Player,,,She's dead.,,
3,77,Emmy,I mean... <kgwait>we all become food for the earth eventually. She just did a little sooner because she was being a canker-blossom.,,,,
3,78,Player,,,Not far enough.,,
3,79,Player,,,Okay then.,,
3,80,Emmy,"Anyway, I think the plants are trying to tell me something. After they took her, they gave me this!",,,,
3,81,Emmy,"Yeah... <kgwait>I suppose they could have torn her up a little more. It would make her better fertilizer.<kgwait> We'll do that next time someone tears up my garden, steals my lunch, and takes my flowers.",,,,
3,82,Player,,,Yeah. Next time.,,
3,86,Player,,,Wanna be in a play?,,
3,87,Emmy,"Oh, I would love to!<kgwait> Please tell me we're doing Jack and the Beanstalk today!",,,,
3,88,Player,,,King Lear.,,
3,89,Emmy,Oh... <kgwait>I don't like that one.,,,,
3,90,Player,,,Why not?,,
3,91,Emmy,"If she's putting it on today, you'll find out shortly.",,,,
3,92,Player,,,I see.,,
3,93,Emmy,"I'm a little disappointed I'm not allowed to check on my flowers on the playground, but the veggies could always use more love!",,,,
3,94,Player,,,Yes they can.,,
7,0,Player,,,,,
7,3,Nugget,,,,,
7,4,Nugget,Nugget is feeling quite strange.,,,,
7,5,Player,,,That's pretty normal for you.,,
7,6,Player,,,Not my problem.,,
7,7,Nugget,Nugget's arm is feeling quite tingly!,,,,
7,8,Nugget,,,,,
7,9,Nugget,Nugget feels much better now.,,,,
7,10,Player,,,Your arm changed.,,
7,11,Player,,,I'm gonna go.,,
7,12,Nugget,What? Oh yes! Nugget's arm is different now.,,,,
7,13,Player,,,It's a claw.,,
7,14,Nugget,Perhaps the goo is trying to tell Nugget something. Nugget feels he should use the claw.,,,,
7,15,Player,,,(Back away slowly.),,
7,16,Nugget,Nugget feels better now! Nugget requires more goo!,,,,
7,17,Nugget,Nugget requires more goo to perform his role.,,,,
7,18,Player,,,I'm working on it.,,
7,19,Nugget,,,,,
7,20,Nugget,Nugget can reach the high goo! Nugget will climb! Nugget will leave the ground to which he has become accustomed and soar like a-,,,,
7,21,Teacher,"<wave>Oh, foul creature! Heed my rhyme!<kgwait><br>Unless we're doing a show, I forbid you to climb!</wave>",,,,
7,22,Nugget,But... <kgwait>but... <kgwait>Nugget needs goo!,,,,
7,23,Teacher,<wave>Then let's put on a show! Go have a look!<kgwait><br>I'm sure there's climbing a beanstalk in one of those books!</wave>,,,,
7,24,Nugget,Nugget is far too shortsighted for that. Nugget will continue desperately trying to reach the goo.,,,,
7,25,Nugget,,,,,
7,26,Nugget,"Nugget cannot reach the goo! Even with the massive plant, Nugget is bound to the Earth.",,,,
7,27,Player,,,There there.,,
7,28,Nugget,Yes! Nugget will-<kgwait> Jack will climb the beanstalk! Jack will climb for goo!,,,,
7,30,Nugget,Nugget is so-<kgwait> Jack is so close to the goo! Jack can taste it! Just a little close-,,,,
7,31,Nugget,,,,,
7,32,Nugget,"Nugget- Jack is so close, but Jack's claw...<kgwait> Jack's claw is bad for climbing.",,,,
7,34,Nugget,Ow.,,,,
7,35,Teacher,"<wave>""OW?!"" That's all you have to say after you let go?!<kgwait><br>You weren't supposed to fall off! You've ruined the show!</wave>",,,,
7,36,Nugget,"Well, maybe the sing-song teacher lady should climb the plant!<kgwait> Nugget did his best! Nugget wanted goo! Nugget's claw is bad for climbing!",,,,
7,37,Teacher,"<wave>Well, while you sit there and insult and mock,<kgwait><br>We need someone else to climb the beanstalk! ",,,,
7,38,Player,,,Hmmmm.,,
7,44,Nugget,Nugget's legs might be broken.,,,,
7,45,Player,,,I feel like you've fallen from farther...,,
7,46,Player,,,"That's rough, buddy.",,
7,47,Nugget,Yes! Onto Nugget's nuggets!<kgwait> But there were no nuggets to break Nugget's fall this time! So now Nugget's legs are broken.,,,,
7,48,Player,,,Do you want help?,,
7,49,Nugget,With what?,,,,
7,50,Player,,,Nevermind then.,,
7,51,Nugget,"Nugget sees the goo, but Nugget cannot reach the goo!",,,,
7,52,Player,,,That's probably for the best.,,
7,53,Nugget,Nugget is getting hungry.,,,,
7,54,Player,,,Are you okay?,,
7,55,Player,,,(Walk away.),,
7,56,Player,,,You're missing lunch.,,
7,57,Nugget,"Yes, Nugget is acutely aware that he is not currently feasting on nuggets.",,,,
7,58,Nugget,Nugget will survive.<kgwait> Nugget has fallen from greater heights.,,,,
7,59,Player,,,True.,,
7,60,Nugget,"That being said, perhaps Nugget could use some medical attention. Nugget is starting to feel funny.",,,,
7,61,Player,,,I'll see what I can do.,,
7,62,Teacher,"<wave>Oh, good heavens! This fills me with dread!<kgwait><br>You're supposed to be cute and sweet to play Red!</wave>",,,,
7,63,Nugget,Nugget is still cute with his claw!,,,,
7,64,Teacher,"<wave>Not cute enough to play Red, I'm afraid!<kgwait><br>Go to the nurse to get that arm some aid!</wave>",,,,
7,65,Nugget,"Nugget is feeling discriminated against, but will go to the nurse cause the goo cravings are concerning Nugget.",,,,
7,66,Nugget,,,,,
7,69,Nugget,Nugget is waiting on his wardrobe for the silly red girl play!,,,,
7,70,Player,,,Here ya go.,,
7,71,Player,,,Still working on that.,,
7,72,Nugget,Nugget feels the red! Nugget is ready to visit grandma!,,,,
7,73,Player,,,"That's great, Nugget.",,
7,101,Teacher,"<wave>Oh, how splendid! I knew you'd do good!<kgwait><br>Places everyone! It's time for Little Red Riding Hood!</wave>",,,,
7,102,Teacher,,,,,
7,103,Teacher,,,,,
7,104,Player,,,Funny how?,,
7,105,Nugget,Nugget's brain is getting foggy. Nugget only sees the goo. Nugget craves flesh.,,,,
7,106,Player,,,(Back away from Nugget.),,
7,107,Player,,,Even after smelling that flower?,,
7,108,Nugget,"Nugget had a moment of clarity, but the goo remains. Nugget likes the goo.",,,,
7,109,Player,,,Smell this.,,
7,110,Nugget,No!<kgwait> The goo tells Nugget to not smell the flower. Nugget will obey the goo.,,,,
7,111,Player,,,Okay then.,,
7,112,Nugget,"Yes, but Nugget's strangeness today is different from other days. Nugget craves more goo.",,,,
7,113,Player,,,Good luck with that.,,
7,114,Player,,,You couldn't get the goo off?,,
7,115,Nugget,"No. Nugget was defeated by the water contraption, but it's okay. Nugget prefers the goo.",,,,
7,116,Player,,,If you say so...,,
7,117,Nugget,Nugget is sad.,,,,
7,118,Player,,,Why is Nugget sad?,,
7,119,Nugget,Nugget could not get the pretty Lily out of the tree. The pretty Lily is staying there. The pretty Lily will not be Nugget's Juliet.,,,,
7,120,Player,,,Let's go get her.,,
7,121,Nugget,Nugget is horrified by his claw!<kgwait> The goo has turned Nugget into a monster!,,,,
7,122,Nugget,,,,,
7,123,Nugget,Do not look at Nugget!<kgwait> Nugget is a monster!<kgwait> LOOK AWAY!,,,,
7,124,Player,,,(Look away.),,
7,125,Nugget,No. The pretty Lily says it's too dangerous since the fake principal man is looking for her now.,,,,
7,126,Player,,,Bummer.,,
7,127,Player,,,(Cure Nugget.),,
7,128,Nugget,What is Nugget's classmate doing with that-,,,,
7,129,PlayerCharacter,,,,,
7,130,Nugget,Nugget feels the goo leaving his body! Nugget sees the goo for what it is! Nugget will rid the world of goo!,,,,
7,131,Player,,,"That's great, Nugget.",,
7,132,Nugget,,,,,
7,134,Nugget,Nugget would like a word with his goo-curing friend... <kgwait>after the matter of the bad robot is resolved.,,,,
7,135,Player,,,Sounds good.,,
7,136,Nugget,The robot is defeated and-<kgwait> Nugget detects an evil device nearby.,,,,
7,137,Player,,,This thing?,,
7,138,Player,,,(Walk away.),,
7,139,Nugget,Yes!<kgwait> The device is EVIL!<kgwait> The device will explode with goo!<kgwait> Get it away from Nugget!,,,,
7,140,Player,,,(Get it away.),,
7,141,Nugget,Nugget thinks we have work to do.,,,,
7,142,Player,,,We do.,,
7,143,Davey,"Okay kid, spill it! Where's my dad?<kgwait> Is he evil? Why did he give you his special duck?!",,,,
7,144,Player,,,We're gonna cure Kevin.,,
7,145,Nugget,Yes. Nugget hears Kevin crying beneath the school. Nugget can hear all the goo! It screams. It howls.,,,,
7,146,Davey,Is that where my dad is? Beneath the school? In Linda's secret lair?,,,,
7,147,Player,,,He's down there.,,
7,148,Davey,"Then we have to go!<kgwait> Linda is normally in her lair during the school day, but I should be able to call her! She listens to me.",,,,
7,149,Nugget,Yes. Summon the gator. Nugget is going to go commune with the animals and the pretty Lily in the tree.,,,,
7,150,Player,,,You need this to cure the animals.,,
7,151,Nugget,Very well! Nugget will begin the process immediately!,,,,
7,152,PlayerCharacter,,,,,
7,153,Nugget,"Come with Nugget, little fishy. Nugget will rid you of goo.",,,,

7,160,Nugget,Nugget appreciates the goo provided already... <kgwait>but Nugget craves more!,,,,
7,161,Player,,,I think you've had enough.,,
7,162,Player,,,I got some.,,
7,163,Nugget,Nugget is thrilled! Nugget will consume the goo after the show! Please keep the goo safe for Nugget.,,,,
7,164,Player,,,Will do.,,
7,165,Player,,,I have some for you.,,
7,166,Nugget,Nugget is grateful! Nugget will consume the goo at a later time.,,,,
7,167,Player,,,That's it?,,
7,168,Nugget,Did Nugget's goo-providing friend expect something in return?,,,,
7,169,Player,,,Kinda.,,
7,170,Nugget,That is too bad for Nugget's goo-providing friend.,,,,
7,171,Player,,,I guess it is.,,
7,172,Player,,,Do you want this?,,
7,173,Nugget,Nugget would love a nugget in these trying times.<kgwait> Just give Nugget a moment.<kgwait> Perhaps bring it to Nugget at lunch time?,,,,
7,174,Player,,,"Sure, buddy.",,
7,175,Player,,,Do you want this?,,
7,176,Nugget,Nugget is grateful!<kgwait> Nugget would give Nugget's nugget-giving friend a hug if-,,,,
7,177,Player,,,If what?,,
7,178,Nugget,If Nugget didn't have a claw.,,,,
7,179,Player,,,"Yeah, that would hurt.",,
7,180,Nugget,Please hug this bear of snuggling instead.,,,,

20,4,Alice,Cause two days ago I was kidnapped and yesterday I was turned into a monster.,,,,
20,5,Player,,,It's been a weird week.,,
20,6,Alice,Yeah. I'm just glad I got away. I don't think Kevin or our old principal got so lucky.,,,,
20,7,Player,,,Who's Kevin?,,
20,8,Player,,,Where's your old principal?,,
20,9,Alice,Another kid that was here. We were pretty good friends. We went missing the same day apparently.,,,,
20,10,Alice,"I dunno. He was here on Monday, but apparently he's gone missing since then.",,,,
20,11,Alice,,,,,
20,17,Player,,,Weird.,,
20,18,Alice,"Yeah, something is definitely going on at this school. I just wish I could remember what happened on Monday.",,,,
20,19,Player,,,Monday?,,
20,20,Alice,"Yeah. That's the day I was taken. I don't remember any of it. I usually keep a diary, but that's missing too.",,,,
20,21,Player,,,I'll keep an eye out for it.,,
20,22,Player,,,Is this yours?,,
20,23,Alice,You found my diary!<kgwait> Where was it?,,,,
20,24,Player,,,A secret lair.,,
20,25,Alice,"You know what this means, right?",,,,
20,26,Player,,,That you tend to lose things?,,
20,27,Player,,,No.,,
20,28,Alice,"No!...<kgwait> Well yes, I guess. But I can also figure out what happened to me on Monday!",,,,
20,29,Player,,,"Oh, good.",,
20,30,Alice,"Oh, hold on a second.<kgwait> The purple pen is missing! It's the only thing that opens the diary.",,,,
20,31,Player,,,Where would it be?,,
20,32,Alice,I honestly have no idea.,,,,
20,33,Player,,,Great.,,
20,34,Alice,"Maybe I could check near the lost and found in the principal's office, but I-<kgwait> I don't want to see Regis again.",,,,
20,35,Player,,,I can check for you.,,
20,37,Alice,It means I can finally remember what happened to me on Monday!,,,,
20,43,Alice,Did he say he'd do it?,,,,
20,44,Player,,,"Yes, but-",,
20,45,Alice,But he wants me to watch him throw a rock?,,,,
20,46,Player,,,Bingo.,,
20,47,Alice,Boys can be so dumb. At least he's a little cute about it.,,,,
20,48,Player,,,At least there's that.,,
20,49,Player,,,Not yet.,,
20,50,Player,,,What's wrong with Regis?,,
20,51,Alice,"I don't know. Dude is kind of a creep. I can't prove it, but I think he had something to do with me going missing.",,,,
20,52,Alice,"Really?!<kgwait> Oh, thank you!<kgwait> Take this just in case things get dicey.",,,,
20,53,Player,,,A knife?,,
20,54,Alice,You can never be too careful. Especially after yesterday.,,,,
20,55,Player,,,Good point.,,
20,56,Player,,,I can look for the pen.,,
20,57,Alice,Did you find the pen?,,,,
20,58,Player,,,Not yet.,,
20,59,Player,,,Yup!,,
20,60,Alice,Yes!<kgwait> Thank you!<kgwait> I can read what I wrote on Monday now!,,,,
20,61,Player,,,What does it say?,,
20,62,Alice,"Hmmm...<kgwait> That's weird. It looks like I played house with Kevin in Mr. Scippio's class, but after that, all the pages have been ripped out.",,,,
20,63,Player,,,Interesting.,,
20,64,Alice,Yeah. Something's not adding up here.,,,,
20,65,Player,,,So what do we do?,,
20,66,Alice,"There must be something I'm not remembering. Maybe if we retrace my steps that day, I can remember what happened after I went to the office!",,,,
20,67,Player,,,That could work.,,
20,68,Alice,So we just need someone who can be Kevin and play house with me.,,,,
20,69,Player,,,Like who?,,
20,70,Alice,"Well, Davey is a total stinking weirdo so that just leaves... Austin.",,,,
20,71,Player,,,I'll see if he's up for it.,,
20,74,Player,,,I can be Kevin.,,
20,75,Alice,"Not the worst idea, but I think it would be better if we chose someone more familiar to me.",,,,
20,76,Player,,,Who's Kevin?,,
20,77,Alice,Another kid that was here. We were pretty good friends. We went missing the same day apparently.,,,,
20,102,Alice,"Hey, Austin!<kgwait> I got a favor to ask.",,,,
20,103,Austin,"Oh!<kgwait> Uh...<kgwait> *ahem*<kgwait> Hey, Alice!<kgwait> What's up?",,,,
20,104,Alice,I need your help recreating my day. Would you wanna play house with me during morning time?,,,,
20,105,Austin,<size=100>Uh yeah!<kgwait> Of course!</size>,,,,
20,106,Austin,I mean... <kgwait>yeah that'd be cool I guess.,,,,
20,107,Alice,Cool! Thanks!,,,,
20,108,Austin,Hey! You wanna watch me throw this rock through that window?,,,,
20,109,Alice,Ummmm... not particularly-,,,,
20,111,Alice,,,,,
20,112,Austin,Hey! Did you see me throw that rock earlier?,,,,
20,113,Alice,Was that why Emmy was crying?,,,,
20,114,Austin,"Uhhh...<kgwait> Nope! That was something different!<kgwait> Anyway, see you during morning time!",,,,
20,115,Alice,,,,,
20,116,Alice,"Thanks, but I'll handle this myself. See you at morning time.",,,,
20,117,Player,,,Okay then.,,
20,118,Player,,,Wanna be in a play?,,
20,119,Alice,Um... <kgwait>no?,,,,
20,120,Player,,,Why not?,,
20,121,Player,,,Okay.,,
20,122,Alice,"My memory is a little fuzzy, but I feel like kids always get hurt in those plays or something? I don't know.<kgwait> Ms. Lovelett can be a little crazy.",,,,
20,123,Player,,,I see.,,
20,124,Player,,,Wanna help with the garden?,,
20,125,Alice,*Sigh*<kgwait> Emmy and her garden.<kgwait> That girl is a little obsessive about her plants. I try not to get involved.,,,,
20,126,Player,,,Noted.,,
21,0,Player,,,,,
21,1,Austin,Hehehe. This is gonna be good.,,,,
21,2,Player,,,I'm not gonna get involved.,,
21,3,Player,,,What's gonna be good?,,
21,4,Austin,"Oh hey, new kid! I'm Austin! Do you like throwing rocks?",,,,
21,5,Player,,,Who doesn't?,,
21,6,Player,,,Not the biggest fan.,,
21,7,Austin,"Hehehe! Me too! I'm trying to get a good shot at that window behind Emmy's garden, but I can't get close enough. Girl is real protective of her plants.",,,,
21,8,Player,,,You could totally make that shot anyway.,,
21,9,Player,,,Maybe we can get her to move.,,
21,10,Austin,"You think? Yeah! Yeah, I could! Here goes!",,,,
21,11,Austin,,,,,
21,12,Austin,"Yeah, maybe. Gonna have to take out the garden for that to work. That's not really my style.",,,,
21,13,Player,,,Good luck with that.,,
21,14,Austin,"Hehehe! Me too! And now that Emmy's gone, I can totally smash this window! Aw yeah!",,,,

21,22,Emmy,<size=100>MS. LOVELETT!</size>,,,,
21,23,Teacher,"<wave>Oh, what's that noise?! I heard a child cry!<kgwait><br>Emmy looks hurt! I would like to know why!</wave>",,,,
21,24,Emmy,Austin just hit me in the face with a rock!,,,,
21,25,Teacher,"<wave>Oh my! How awful, but it could have been worse!<kgwait><br>But just to be safe, please go to the nurse!</wave>",,,,
21,26,Teacher,"<wave>And as for you, Austin, that was not nice at all!<kgwait><br>I'm going to have to give you study hall!</wave>",,,,
21,27,Austin,"Aw c'mon, Ms. L! It was an accident! I said I was sorry.",,,,
21,28,Teacher,"<wave>The apology is appreciated. It was very nice.<kgwait><br>But hopefully next time, you'll think twice.</wave>",,,,
21,38,Teacher,,,,,
21,39,Austin,"Well, shoot. That didn't go as planned. Looks like I'll be in study hall.",,,,
21,40,Player,,,Yay study hall.,,
21,41,Austin,"Aw, it won't be so bad! I get study hall all the time.",,,,
21,42,Player,,,I suppose so.,,
21,45,Player,,,Have fun in study hall.,,
21,47,Austin,,,,,
21,48,Austin,Woohoo! That was awesome! I love breaking stuff!,,,,
21,49,Player,,,Woohoo!,,
21,50,Austin,,,,,
21,51,Teacher,<wave>Austin! How dare you?! What's the matter?!<kgwait><br> I told you no throwing rocks! It makes glass shatter!</wave>,,,,
21,52,Austin,"Oh! Hehe. Sorry, Ms. L. I didn't mean anything by it.",,,,
21,53,Teacher,<wave>It doesn't matter what your intentions were!<kgwait><br>I'm giving you study hall for causing a stir!</wave>,,,,
21,54,Teacher,"<wave>And to make sure no one climbs through,<kgwait><br> I'll call the hall monitor! That's what I'll do!",,,,
21,55,Stevie,"Hall monitor reporting for duty, ma'am!",,,,
21,56,Teacher,<wave>Thank goodness you're here! You heard my cry!<kgwait><br>Go block that window! Don't let anyone by!</wave>,,,,
21,57,Stevie,"Understood! No one will get by me!<kgwait> By the way, you left the door to your classroom unlocked this morning.",,,,
21,58,Stevie,,,,,
21,59,Player,,,Who doesn't?,,
21,60,Austin,I love breaking stuff!<kgwait> I do miss my rock though.,,,,
21,61,Player,,,The cost of joy...,,
21,62,Austin,I really don't wanna be out here doing this.,,,,
21,63,Janitor,Well you shoulda though of that before you hit me with that lump of meat. Now shut up!<kgwait> She'll hear you!,,,,
21,64,Player,,,I'm not gonna get involved.,,
21,65,Player,,,Can you help Alice with something?,,
21,66,Austin,What?!<kgwait> Alice wants my help?<kgwait> No way!<kgwait> This is so great! Does she want to see me throw this rock?!,,,,
21,67,Player,,,Probably.,,
21,68,Player,,,I don't think so.,,
21,69,Austin,"Woohoo! Hey, Alice!<kgwait> Come over here!",,,,
21,70,Alice,So you'll do it? You'll help me act out what happened to me on Mon-,,,,
21,71,Austin,"Yeah, yeah yeah. Check this out!",,,,
21,72,Austin,Oh... <kgwait>darn. Well will she watch me throw it anyway?,,,,
21,73,Player,,,"If you'll help her, then yes.",,
21,74,Alice,"Great... <kgwait>Anyway, meet me by the dollhouse during morning time. ",,,,
21,75,Austin,You got it!,,,,
21,76,Alice,,,,,
21,77,Player,,,Wanna be in a play?,,
21,78,Austin,"Huh? Oh hey, kid!<kgwait> Nah, Ms. L doesn't like it when I'm in her plays.<kgwait> My attention span is pretty short so I tend to forget my lines.",,,,
21,79,Player,,,Oh.,,
21,80,Austin,Yeah...<kgwait> Do you like throwing rocks?,,,,
21,81,Austin,Oh.<kgwait> Well let me know if you change your mind!,,,,
21,82,Player,,,Will do.,,
21,83,Austin,Looks like I'll be in study hall.<kgwait> I just hope Emmy's okay.,,,,
21,84,Player,,,I'm sure she will be.,,
21,85,Austin,"Well, shoot. That didn't go as planned. Looks like I'll be in study hall.",,,,
21,86,Teacher,"<wave>Silly me! You're so right!<kgwait><br>I'll run inside, and lock it up tight!",,,,
22,0,Player,,,,,
22,1,Carla,So much to do... so little time.,,,,
22,2,Player,,,I'll leave her to whatever she's doing.,,
22,3,Player,,,What are you scheming?,,
22,4,Carla,"I don't know if you've noticed kid, but we're at a new school! That means I gotta reestablish some... shortcuts if you catch my drift.",,,,
22,5,Player,,,Shortcuts?,,
22,6,Carla,Yeah! There are probably tons of secret ways to get between rooms that the adults don't know about.,,,,
22,7,Player,,,See any nearby?,,
22,8,Player,,,Have fun with that.,,
22,9,Carla,You see that kid over there? The punk version of the fat kid from our last school?,,,,
22,10,Player,,,What about him?,,
22,11,Carla,I think he's looking to break a window. That could be really useful for getting past the sing-song lady guarding the door.,,,,
22,12,Player,,,Sounds like a plan.,,
22,13,Player,,,That's not really a plan.,,
22,14,Carla,"Not everything requires lasers, bombs, and robots you dummy. Sometimes a rock in the right place is all you need.",,,,
22,15,Carla,It's far simpler than the stuff we were doing yesterday for sure.,,,,
22,16,Player,,,Fair enough.,,
22,17,Player,,,Low bar.,,
22,18,Carla,Go talk him into breaking the window while I keep the teacher busy so she doesn't see him do it.,,,,
22,19,Player,,,Okay.,,
22,20,Carla,,,,,
22,21,Carla,...So you're saying there's an air duct system? Would there happen to be a vent in an easily accesible place like...<kgwait>I dunno...<kgwait> the bathroom?,,,,
22,22,Teacher,"<wave>Yes, indeed! There's a vent for air!<kgwait><br>But that's very suspicious. Why do you care?</wave>",,,,
22,23,Carla,No reason. Just interested in my new place of learning is all.,,,,
22,24,Carla,,,,,
22,25,Player,,,Why do we care if she sees?,,
22,26,Player,,,Gimme a second.,,
22,28,Carla,"Cause if she sees, she won't let us climb through a broken window. Duh.",,,,
22,29,Carla,"Fine, but hurry up. I want this done before the bell rings.",,,,
22,30,Player,,,Sure.,,
22,31,Carla,"Good. You know the drill, kid. Make it quick. I won't hold her attention long.",,,,
22,32,Player,,,Got it.,,
22,33,Carla,You ready to go talk that kid into breaking that window?<kgwait> I'll hold the teacher's attention while you do it.,,,,
22,35,Carla,So I can't help but notice that the window isn't broken.,,,,
22,36,Player,,,Good eye.,,
22,37,Carla,"Yeah thanks.<kgwait> Apparently, what I don't have a good eye for is shortcut finding partners.<kgwait> Get lost.",,,,
22,38,Player,,,Get lost.,,
22,39,Carla,Get lost kid. You already screwed everything up today.,,,,
22,40,Player,,,Darn it.,,
22,41,Carla,"Nice work, kid! Let's go check it out.",,,,
22,42,Player,,,Let's go.,,
22,43,Carla,Shoot!<kgwait> Stevie is right there! You gotta go in there and distract him so I can get into the bathroom.,,,,
22,45,Player,,,I got this.,,
22,46,Player,,,The bathroom?,,
22,47,Carla,Yeah!<kgwait> The teacher said there's an air vent in there. I'm gonna see if I can access the duct system for shortcuts!,,,,
22,48,Carla,Well? Did you do it? Are all the vents open?,,,,
22,49,Player,,,Done and done.,,
22,50,Player,,,Ummm... no.,,
22,51,Carla,"Way to go, partner!<kgwait> This is so great! I knew I could trust you!",,,,
22,52,Player,,,I'm so trustworthy.,,
22,53,Carla,"Yeah, yeah.<kgwait> Here's something for you. I made a map of all the vents. It should help you navigate them.",,,,
22,54,Player,,,Nifty.,,
22,55,Carla,"Yeah. Heh. I'll probably run into you in there.<kgwait> See you around, kid.",,,,
22,56,Player,,,See you around.,,
22,57,Carla,"Oh. Jeez, I thought you had it.<kgwait> Way to trip at the finish line kid.",,,,
22,58,Player,,,I was so close.,,
22,59,Carla,"Yeah well, close doesn't cut it in my line of work.<kgwait> Gimme back my screwdriver and get lost.",,,,
22,60,Player,,,(Get lost.),,
22,61,Player,,,See any nearby?,,
22,62,Carla,"Yeah, but we're not gonna do this in the demo. Stick with the teacher, kid.",,,,
22,63,Player,,,Fine.,,
22,64,Player,,,Wanna be in a play?,,
22,65,Carla,"*Psh*<kgwait> Yeah, right.<kgwait> I wouldn't be caught dead in a play.",,,,
22,66,Player,,,A simple 'no' would have sufficed.,,
22,67,Player,,,The rock hit that girl.,,
22,68,Carla,Oh. Darn it!<kgwait> Boys can't do anything right!<kgwait> We should probably get her to move out of the way before he throws the rock next time.,,,,
22,69,Player,,,Good idea.,,
22,70,Carla,"We'll try again tomorrow, kid.",,,,
22,71,Player,,,Okay.,,
22,72,Carla,Darn it. There goes that plan.,,,,
22,73,Player,,,What plan?,,
22,74,Player,,,(Walk away.),,
22,75,Carla,"I was gonna try and sneak through that window after that kid broke it, but Stevie is blocking it.",,,,
22,76,Player,,,Darn.,,
22,77,Player,,,Wanna help with a garden?,,
22,78,Carla,No way. These hands are for smuggling operations only.,,,,
22,79,Player,,,Fair enough.,,
22,80,Carla,,,,,
22,81,Player,,,Gimme a minute.,,
23,0,Player,,,,,
23,1,Monty,This is so humiliating. Easily the second worst day of my life.,,,,
23,2,Player,,,(Walk away from Monty.),,
23,3,Player,,,Nice dress.,,
23,4,Monty,No it's not! Everything got so screwed up! I don't know how to fix it!,,,,
23,5,Player,,,Fix what?,,
23,6,Monty,Notice anything different about me from yesterday?,,,,
23,7,Player,,,The dress.,,
23,8,Player,,,"Oh, hey you're walking again.",,
23,9,Player,,,You're T-posing.,,
23,10,Monty,I meant besides the dress!,,,,
23,11,Monty,"Yeah! After you guys killed Penny, I went down to the secret lab and found all sorts of crazy robot parts. I was able to use the tech to get my legs working again.",,,,
23,12,Player,,,And the dress?,,
23,13,Monty,A lot of the circuits run through this thing. It's a little above my paygrade to make a new one so I just sort of have to wear the dress if I want to walk.,,,,
23,14,Player,,,And your arms?,,
23,15,Monty,Yeah... <kgwait>turns out there's only enough power in the system to power either my arms or legs. I chose legs.,,,,
23,16,Player,,,How do we get you more power?,,
23,17,Monty,*Sigh*... <kgwait>I know. My arms don't work anymore. It's the cost of BEING ABLE TO WALK AGAIN.,,,,
23,18,Monty,"Penny's system runs on this green goo stuff, but unless there's some goo powered battery lying around, I think I'm out of luck.",,,,
23,26,Player,,,What was the worst day?,,
23,27,Monty,The day that delusional old man hit me with that mop for correcting his spelling.,,,,
23,28,Player,,,That seems so long ago.,,
23,29,Monty,"It was literally two days ago! Jeez, you have a short memory.",,,,
23,30,Player,,,Looks like he's in rough shape.,,
23,31,Monty,Yeah. Stupid geezer tried to take on the gator in the pond over there.,,,,
23,32,Player,,,Why?,,
23,33,Monty,I don't know. Maybe he got tired of killing kids and wanted something that put up more of a fight.,,,,
23,34,Player,,,Can I buy something?,,
23,35,Monty,I wish. My arms don't work anymore.,,,,
23,38,Player,,,Good luck with that.,,
23,39,Player,,,Wanna be in a play?,,
23,40,Monty,"Two questions: Does it pay, and do I have to use my arms?",,,,
23,41,Player,,,Yes and yes.,,
23,42,Player,,,Yes and no.,,
23,43,Player,,,No and yes.,,
23,44,Player,,,No and no.,,
23,45,Monty,Well I can't use my arms so... <kgwait>the answer is no.,,,,
23,46,Player,,,Darn.,,
23,47,Monty,"Oh, how convenient.<kgwait> How much does it pay?",,,,
23,48,Player,,,A lot.,,
23,49,Monty,"Then knowing what you know about me, why would you even ask?",,,,
23,50,Player,,,Good point.,,
23,51,Monty,"No pay, no play. Get lost kid.",,,,
23,52,Player,,,(Get lost.),,
23,53,Monty,How much?,,,,
23,54,Player,,,Ummmm...,,
23,55,Monty,I knew it. You're lying.<kgwait> No way a kindergarten play has the budget to actually pay actors. Get lost.,,,,
23,56,Player,,,I'll keep an eye out.,,
23,57,Player,,,Is this a goo battery?,,
23,58,Monty,Uh... yeah. Yeah it is.<kgwait> IT IS! Where did you-?<kgwait> Doesn't matter! Slap it on the little charger looking thing on my back.,,,,
23,59,Player,,,(Slappy slappy.),,
23,60,Monty,"Woah! I can feel the energy! C'mon, arms! C'mon! Move!",,,,
23,61,Monty,,,,,
23,62,Monty,,,,,
23,63,Monty,I can't believe it!<kgwait> They work! I haven't felt joy like this since I closed that deal in Bangkok! Thank you so much!,,,,
23,64,Player,,,No problem.,,
23,65,Monty,"I normally don't do freebies, but I think this calls for a special favor. You can have one of these bad boys.",,,,
23,66,Player,,,A pill?,,
23,67,Monty,"Yeah, it's the good stuff. You know that Applegate is a real sucker for these.",,,,
23,68,Player,,,"Oh, thanks. ",,
23,69,Monty,Pleasure doing business with ya.,,,,
23,70,Player,,,"Always is, Monty.",,
23,75,Monty,"Well, well, well. What do we have here?<kgwait> Looks like someone had a deal go south.<kgwait> Pity.",,,,
23,76,Felix,You'll-<kgwait> You'll regret having ever messed with the Huxley's! We don't forgive!<kgwait> We don't forget-,,,,
23,77,Monty,,,,,
23,78,Felix,Please-<kgwait> Please don't answer that. Father will be so-,,,,
23,79,Monty,What?<kgwait> Daddy's gonna be mad you got his chopper blown up?<kgwait> Too bad. I'm putting this sucker on speaker.,,,,
23,80,Huxley,<wiggle><voffset=-0.25em><size=80>FELIX NORSTUBBLE WEALTHINGTON HUXLEY III!!</size></voffset></wiggle>,,,,
23,81,Felix,Father...<kgwait> I can expla-,,,,
23,82,Huxley,An Applesoft chopper was shot down! WHAT HAPPENED!?!?,,,,
23,83,Monty,"Hey, Mr. Fancypants!<kgwait> I shot down your stupid chopper.<kgwait> Your spoiled little brat of an offspring tried to double cross me.",,,,
23,84,Huxley,And you would be?,,,,
23,85,Monty,Monty.<kgwait> Your son was supposed to get me in at-,,,,
23,86,Huxley,I know who you are.<kgwait> I'm very sorry about all this. Please accept my humble apologies.,,,,
23,87,Monty,That's what I like to hear.<kgwait> Send me a limo and we'll chat.,,,,
23,88,Huxley,It's on the way. I look forward to finally meeting you.<kgwait> Is Felix's assistant still there?,,,,
23,89,Player,,,"Hi, Mr. Felix.",,
23,90,Huxley,"Please give him the phone, Monty. The limo will pick you up momentarily.",,,,
23,91,Monty,Good enough for me.<kgwait> Pleasure doing business with ya.,,,,
23,92,Player,,,"It always is, Monty.",,
23,93,Huxley,Is he gone?,,,,
23,94,Player,,,Yup.,,
23,95,Huxley,Good.<kgwait> There was something very important on that chopper. I never would have given it to you if I knew Monty was there.,,,,
23,96,Player,,,How do you know Monty?,,
23,97,Player,,,What is it?,,
23,98,Huxley,He sabotaged a deal I was making in Bangkok.,,,,
23,99,Player,,,Wow.,,
23,100,Huxley,"That school is a hotspot for green goo. Applesoft made an antidote that can revert the goo mutation process completely. I was giving some to you for helping Felix, as you'll likely need it.",,,,
23,101,Player,,,Why can't Monty have it?,,
23,102,Huxley,Because that little devil will probably turn it into drugs like he did the last time he got his hands on one of Applesoft's proprietary chemicals!,,,,
23,103,Player,,,That's fair.,,
23,104,Huxley,Felix!<kgwait> Can you do something right for once and get that chemical back here?,,,,
23,105,Felix,Father-<kgwait> I-<kgwait> I'm afraid my legs don't appear to be working...<kgwait> I may also be on fire right now.,,,,
23,106,Huxley,"*Bah!*<kgwait> It's a good thing I have two sons. What about you, 'assistant?' Can you secure the chemical?",,,,
23,107,Player,,,Can do.,,
23,108,Felix,What-<kgwait> what about me Father? I'm actually quite sure I'm burning and I don't think I'll-,,,,
23,109,Huxley,"As far as I'm concerned, you're a lame, soon to be well-done, orphan.",,,,
23,110,Felix,"But- but-<kgwait> Father, please! Please don't leave me! You can't treat me like Teddy!",,,,
23,111,Huxley,Actually it's going to be Teddy who I'll be treating more like you.<kgwait> He's clearly superior. He beat you fair and square.,,,,
23,112,Felix,Noooo. No no no no. Please... <kgwait>no.,,,,
23,113,Huxley,"Now then, assistant, I've sent a separate limo for you.<kgwait> Please don't keep Driverton waiting. I'll need him to take me on my date later.",,,,
23,114,Player,,,Tally ho.,,
23,115,Huxley,Yes. I was both impressed and... <kgwait>well pissed off to be honest.,,,,
23,116,Player,,,What was on the chopper?,,
23,117,Monty,It-<kgwait> it's for-<kgwait> for you.,,,,
23,118,Player,,,Hello?,,
23,119,Huxley,Hello?<kgwait> Felix's assistant?<kgwait> It's Huxley.,,,,
23,120,Player,,,"Hi, Mr. Felix.",,
23,121,Huxley,"I take it by the nature of you answering this call, that Felix got on the chopper.",,,,
23,122,Player,,,He did.,,
23,123,Huxley,Excellent!<kgwait> Maybe he still has some potential. I'm happy he was able to figure everything out.,,,,
23,124,Player,,,Yeah. He's real smart.,,
23,125,Huxley,"As for your reward, Felix was instructed to give it to this courier with the phone.",,,,
23,126,Player,,,What is it?,,
23,127,Huxley,"That school is a hotspot for green goo. Applesoft made an antidote that can revert the goo mutation process completely. I am giving some to you for helping Felix, as you'll likely need it.",,,,
23,128,Player,,,That's helpful.,,
23,129,Huxley,"Yes, I'm sure you'll find many uses for it.<kgwait> Now if you'll excuse me, I have a date tonight.",,,,
23,130,Player,,,Oh. Yeah. Good luck with that.,,
23,131,Huxley,"Good day, assistant.",,,,
23,132,Player,,,Good day.,,
23,133,Player,,,Where did you come from?,,
23,134,Monty,He-<kgwait> pushed me out of the chopper. That no-good double-crossing-,,,,
23,135,Player,,,(Answer the phone.),,
23,136,Monty,Hmmm...<kgwait> I think Ted's little predicament might be a lucrative opportunity.,,,,
23,137,Player,,,Oh?,,
23,138,Player,,,That's great.,,
23,139,Monty,Yeah. Just do what he says for now. I'll be in touch.,,,,
24,0,Player,,,,,
24,1,Davey,"Don't you worry, Linda. I'm not gonna let him hurt you! ",,,,
24,2,Player,,,(Walk away.),,
24,3,Player,,,Who tried to hurt Linda?,,
24,4,Davey,"It's that janitor from your old school. He just tried to stick that mop through Linda's skull, but she fought him off.",,,,
24,6,Davey,Have you not been paying attention? Principals at multiple elementary schools have been kidnapping and experimenting on kids.,,,,
24,7,Player,,,Oh. That.,,
24,8,Player,,,Who's Linda?,,
24,9,Davey,"Oh hey, kid. I'm Davey and this is Linda,<kgwait> the REAL school mascot. Not the stupid ducks. My dad always wanted to get rid of her, but now he's gone so at least we get to keep her.",,,,
24,10,Player,,,Are... are you talking about the gator?,,
24,11,Player,,,Your dad is missing?,,
24,12,Davey,Duh! Isn't she the coolest?! I'll bet we're the only school in the county with a real live gator!,,,,
24,13,Davey,"Yeah. I'm pretty sure he's evil anyway, so good riddance. All I need is Linda anyway.",,,,
24,14,Player,,,Why is your dad evil?,,
24,16,Davey,,,,,
24,77,Davey,Yeah.<kgwait> THAT.<kgwait> Now leave us alone. I gotta make sure Linda is okay after that attack.,,,,
24,78,Player,,,We should protect her!,,
24,79,Davey,Yeah! We should-<kgwait> Hey!<kgwait> How do I know you're not working for that janitor?,,,,
24,80,Player,,,Working for him?,,
24,81,Player,,,I'm definitely not.,,
24,82,Davey,Yeah! You could be a spy! I don't trust you! Prove to me that you're not a spy!,,,,
24,83,Player,,,How do I prove it?,,
24,84,Davey,Oh yeah?<kgwait> Prove it!,,,,
24,85,Davey,Go defend Linda's honor! Tell that janitor to leave her alone for good!,,,,
24,86,Player,,,I'm sure this will go over well.,,
24,89,Davey,Okay. You're definitely not a spy.,,,,
24,90,Player,,,"Oh, really?",,
24,91,Davey,Yeah. That was commitment. Linda would be happy to have you help me kill that janitor.,,,,
24,92,Player,,,Is that the plan?,,
24,93,Davey,Yup. Linda's worked it all out. I just gotta steal the fire axe from the classroom.,,,,
24,94,Player,,,"Oh, is that all?",,
24,95,Davey,"Yeah. According to Linda, the janitor's weakness is getting his head split open with an axe.",,,,
24,96,Player,,,How do we get the axe?,,
24,97,Davey,We need a copy of the teacher's playbook. We gotta put on Little Red Riding Hood. It's the only one that uses the axe.,,,,
24,98,Player,,,I have a copy.,,
24,99,Player,,,How do we get a copy?,,
24,100,Davey,She only gives out a copy to kids dedicated to her crazy theatre productions. Go help her out and come back with it tomorrow.,,,,
24,101,Davey,"Woah, no way!<kgwait> That's so great! No wonder Linda picked you.",,,,
24,102,Player,,,Yeah. No wonder.,,
24,103,Davey,"Okay, cool. Go tell the teacher you want to put on that play. We're gonna get that axe and save Linda!",,,,
24,104,Player,,,I'm on it.,,
24,105,Davey,,,,,
24,106,Davey,"I'm not talking to you until you defend Linda's honor!<kgwait> Until then, you're a spy!",,,,
24,107,Player,,,Okay okay.,,
24,108,Davey,,,,,
24,109,Davey,Well?<kgwait> Are we putting on the play?,,,,
24,110,Player,,,Yup.,,
24,111,Player,,,I haven't asked yet.,,
24,112,Davey,"C'mon, kid! Get a move on! We gotta put on Red Riding Hood so I can get the axe! Linda's life depends on it!",,,,
24,113,Player,,,I'm on it.,,
24,114,Davey,"Awesome! When she calls for the cast, I'll volunteer to be the axe man.<kgwait> You just gotta focus on recruiting the other characters and getting the hood.",,,,
24,115,Player,,,What other characters?,,
24,116,Davey,"Well, we need a Little Red Riding Hood and a wolf. I'd focus on getting Little Red since there are a few kids out here who might take the role.",,,,
24,117,Player,,,Good idea.,,
24,118,Davey,"Oh, and one more thing.<kgwait> Linda gives these out to those she deems friends. Here you go.",,,,
24,119,Player,,,What is it?,,
24,120,Davey,She calls them Nuggets of Friendship. Hopefully it comes in handy for you.,,,,
24,121,Player,,,"Oh, I think it might.",,
24,122,Davey,,,,,
24,123,Player,,,Ya don't say?,,
24,124,Davey,Linda's pretty smart so I think she's right.,,,,
24,125,Player,,,"Oh, bummer.",,
24,126,Player,,,(Walk away.),,
24,127,Player,,,Good luck with that.,,
24,128,Player,,,You do that.,,
24,129,Player,,,I'm not gonna bother with this.,,
24,130,Davey,You can't in this demo. Only the teacher's mission will work.,,,,
24,131,Player,,,Oh.,,
24,132,Player,,,Wanna be in a play?,,
24,133,Davey,Will it help protect Linda?,,,,
24,134,Player,,,Who's Linda?,,
24,135,Davey,The beautiful alligator right in front of you!<kgwait> Duh!,,,,
24,136,Player,,,I don't think a play will help her.,,
24,137,Davey,Then I'm not doing it.,,,,
24,138,Player,,,Fair enough.,,
24,139,Player,,,I don't think a play will help her.,,
24,140,Davey,"C'mon, Linda!<kgwait> Come back!<kgwait> Please come back!<kgwait> Listen to the sound of my voice!",,,,
24,141,Player,,,(Let him work.),,
24,142,Davey,"I think she heard me!<kgwait> C'mon, Linda!<kgwait> Please!<kgwait> We need you!",,,,
24,143,PlayerCharacter,,,,,
24,144,Davey,"You came!<kgwait> Thank you, Linda!<kgwait> I can see my dad again!",,,,
24,145,Davey,"Okay, kid!<kgwait> Are you ready-",,,,
24,146,Davey,Oh. Wow...<kgwait> There's a lot of you.,,,,
24,147,Player,,,Is that a problem?,,
24,148,Davey,Ummm...<kgwait> Lemme ask.,,,,
24,149,Player,,,You do that.,,
24,150,Davey,"I see.<kgwait> Yeah, that seems fair.<kgwait> Thanks, Linda!",,,,
24,151,Davey,We're good. Let's go!,,,,
24,152,Player,,,We're good?,,
24,153,Davey,Um...<kgwait> Yeah. She said she'll take her cut later.,,,,
24,154,Player,,,Her cut?,,
24,155,Davey,"Listen kid, if you wanna do this, this is our only option. Now let's go!",,,,
24,156,Player,,,Fair enough.,,
24,157,Nugget,"ALL OF NUGGET'S FRIENDS, ANIMAL AND NOT-ANIMAL! ENTER YET ANOTHER ANIMAL!",,,,
24,158,Lily,*Sigh*<kgwait> The things I do to save other kids...,,,,
24,159,Nugget,,,,,
24,160,Nugget,Booboo says he and Birdy will go down the slide.,,,,
24,161,Player,,,Will that work?,,
24,162,Nugget,Yes. The slide detects goo genes. Booboo and Birdy have goo genes. Nugget and his friends can embark in the alligator.,,,,
24,163,Player,,,(Embark.),,
24,164,Player,,,Where can I get that?,,
24,165,Davey,"I think they keep extra sheets and towels somewhere in the bathroom.<kgwait> They're white though, so you'll have to find a way to make it red.",,,,
24,167,Davey,I'm gonna be the axe man. Focus the other characters right now. It wouldn't hurt to get a sheet for them to wear either.,,,,
24,168,Player,,,I'm on it.,,
24,169,Davey,You should also try and find a hood of some sort.,,,,
24,170,Player,,,We're doing Romeo and Juliet.,,
24,171,Davey,Darn it!<kgwait> That play only uses poison and knives!<kgwait> We'll never get that axe now!,,,,
24,172,Player,,,Sorry about that.,,
24,173,Davey,"I'll figure something else out.<kgwait> I'll see you around, kid.",,,,
24,174,Player,,,See ya.,,
24,175,Davey,"Romeo and Juliet.<kgwait> What a joke.<kgwait> We'll figure something else out, Linda.",,,,
24,176,Player,,,(Let him grumble to himself.),,
24,177,Player,,,I'm bleeding.,,
24,178,Davey,Yeah!<kgwait> That's it!<kgwait> We can use your blood to make a sheet red!,,,,
24,179,Player,,,Ew.,,
24,180,Davey,"These are desperate times, kid. Don't go to the nurse until you have that sheet.",,,,
24,181,Player,,,I'm friends with Linda.,,
24,182,Davey,Oh!<kgwait> That's awesome!<kgwait> It's good to know Linda has more friends around here than just me.,,,,
24,183,Player,,,What do I do with this?,,
24,184,Davey,"You can feed it to Linda and she'll take you to her secret lair!<kgwait> I haven't been in awhile, but it's a cool little hangout.",,,,
24,185,Player,,,Good to know.,,
24,186,Player,,,Yeah. Good thing.,,
24,187,Davey,It's pretty cool that Linda trusts someone else around here.,,,,
24,188,Player,,,"Yes, it is.",,
25,0,Player,,,,,
25,1,Emmy,*sniff*... Why would she do that? All of the poor plants and vegetables... *sob*... She ruined everything.,,,,
25,2,Player,,,She's pretty awful.,,
25,3,Emmy,What will I do? All of my friends are gone. How can I rebuild my garden?,,,,
25,4,Player,,,I'll help you.,,
25,5,Player,,,Good luck with that.,,
25,6,Emmy,"You will!? Oh, thank you! We'll have to get started right away! There's so much to do!",,,,
25,7,Player,,,Where do we start?,,
25,8,Emmy,"The nurse has some herbs we can use, or maybe we can use some of the seed samples that are in the library. We only need one though.",,,,
25,9,Player,,,How do I get to the nurse?,,
25,10,Player,,,How do I get the seeds?,,
25,11,Emmy,"You'll have to get sick. If I ever want to get out of class, I just eat some green goo that's lying around and then tell the teacher I don't feel good.",,,,
25,12,Emmy,"Well you'll have to get to the library, but that's kinda hard to do before study hall unless you know what you're doing.",,,,
25,13,Player,,,Why's that?,,
25,14,Emmy,"The library is locked until study hall time, but I also hear that the hall monitor from your last school is in there. It won't be easy.",,,,
25,15,Player,I think I can handle that.,,,,
25,16,Emmy,"Okay. Once the nurse fixes you up, ask about the herbs. I'll meet you in the classroom and we'll tackle the next few things.",,,,
25,17,Player,Sounds good to me.,,,,
25,18,Player,I can do it.,,,,
25,19,Emmy,If you say so. I would get going though. We need to have it planted by morning time.,,,,
25,20,Player,,,Got it.,,
26,0,Felix,,,,,
26,1,Felix,,,,,
26,2,Felix,,,,,
26,3,Felix,,,,,
26,4,Felix,,,,,
26,5,Felix,,,,,
26,6,Felix,,,,,
26,7,Felix,,,,,
26,8,Felix,,,,,
26,9,Felix,,,,,
27,0,Player,,,,,
27,1,Felix,"Unbelievable! You'll pay for this, Teddy!",,,,
27,2,Player,,,"Hi, Ted.",,
27,3,Felix,<size=100>I AM NOT TEDDY! I'M FELIX!</size>,,,,
27,4,Player,,,You look like Ted.,,
27,5,Felix,"We're twins, you ignoramus! Teddy got the bright idea to swap our clothes today so he gets to go to the fancy academy and I get stuck at this vile institution! ",,,,
27,6,Player,,,Hehe. Classic Ted.,,
27,7,Felix,"Yes, Teddy has been acting far more fiendishly than usual as of late. He must be stopped. I must get out of here!",,,,
27,8,Player,,,I'm just gonna move along.,,
27,9,Player,,,Well it was nice catching up.,,
27,10,Player,,,How do you plan to do that?,,
27,11,Felix,"That imbecile of a driver wouldn't listen to me, but I'm sure Father would. We must acquire a phone and call him immediately.",,,,
27,12,Player,,,Good plan.,,
27,13,Felix,Of course it's a good plan.<kgwait> I'd assume that penny pinching nerd boy over there would have one... <kgwait>but he looks a little... incompetent?,,,,
27,14,Player,,,Incompetent?,,
27,15,Felix,His arms seem a little... <kgwait>stiff. Could you sort that out so I don't have to talk to someone with that particular... <kgwait>condition?,,,,
27,22,Felix,,,,,
27,26,Felix,"No!<kgwait> Stop!<kgwait> Come back, you idiot!",,,,
27,28,Player,,,Wanna be in a play?,,
27,29,Felix,I was just violently thrown from a moving vehicle. You think joining your play is important to me right now?,,,,
27,30,Player,,,You get to be an earl.,,
27,31,Player,,,You get an evil girlfriend.,,
27,32,Felix,An earl?!<kgwait> Please don't insult me.<kgwait> I'm a king.,,,,
27,33,Felix,That would be appealing if I wasn't so exhausted from courting Cindy yesterday.,,,,
27,34,Player,,,You get to boss other kids around.,,
27,35,Felix,"Do I really?<kgwait> I mean...<kgwait> I do that already, but it would be nice to do it in an official capacity. Almost like a king!",,,,
27,36,Player,,,Fine. Be a king.,,
27,37,Player,,,So you'll do it?,,
27,38,Felix,Perhaps.<kgwait> But I'll need a token to confirm my kingship.,,,,
27,39,Player,,,A token?,,
27,40,Felix,"Yes, you simpleton. I need something to show off my status. I need... <kgwait>a crown.",,,,
27,41,Player,,,I'll see what I can do.,,
27,42,Felix,"Good. I'll sign your casting sheet then, but no performance until I look like proper royalty.",,,,
27,43,Player,,,You got it.,,
27,44,Felix,Excellent.<kgwait> Now I'll just need a token to exemplify my kingship.,,,,
27,45,Felix,Just have that crown ready for me by the time the production starts and I will be the most powerful king you've ever seen!,,,,
27,46,Player,,,Can't wait.,,
27,47,Felix,"Unbelievable! You'll pay for this, Teddy!",,,,
27,48,Felix,"Good day, shopkeeper. I see your unfortunate ailment has resolved itself.",,,,
27,49,Monty,"Hey, Ted. Yeah, I'm good as new. What can I do ya for?",,,,
27,50,Felix,Father had me sent to the wrong school. I require a phone to call him so that he can send someone to pick me up.,,,,
27,51,Monty,"Unfortunately, I'm outta phones, but if you get one, could I borrow it after lunch? I'm hosting a-",,,,
27,52,Felix,Darn it!<kgwait> I must call Father! There has to be a way.,,,,
27,53,Monty,"Well, if it helps, I can see through that window that there's a phone in the office.",,,,
27,54,Felix,"Oh, splendid.<kgwait> Here's Father's card. Please call him and tell him to retrieve me posthaste!",,,,
27,55,Monty,"Woah, woah, woah. I only do errands for a premium. You got twenty bucks on you?",,,,
27,56,Felix,I'm afraid Teddy keeps his pockets tragically light.,,,,
27,57,Monty,Then forget it.,,,,
27,58,Felix,"Ugh.<kgwait> What about you, street urchin? Care to be my assistant?",,,,
27,59,Player,,,Me?,,

27,63,Player,,,What's in it for me?,,
27,64,Felix,You'll be my honorary assistant and I'm sure Father will reward you for correcting this egregious error.,,,,
27,65,Player,,,Let's go talk to Mr. Felix.,,
27,66,Felix,Huxley. The name is Huxley. Get it right. Father can be rather indignant. I'll be waiting for your good news after the bell rings.,,,,
27,67,Player,,,Of course.,,
27,68,Felix,"Good day, shopkeeper. One phone please.",,,,
27,69,Monty,"I'm always happy to drain that little trust fund of yours, but the shop is closed until I can get my arms working again.",,,,
27,70,Felix,What ruse is this? I was told you could get anyone anything!,,,,
27,71,Monty,"Yeah and on a good day I could, but things have changed since yesterday. So unless you have a goo powered battery of some sort, we're both out of luck.",,,,
27,72,Felix,"I see. Well I can be rather cunning too. If it's a goo battery you need, then perhaps I can acquire one myself.",,,,
27,73,Monty,Good luck with that.,,,,
27,74,Felix,,,,,
27,75,Monty,Good luck with that.,,,,
27,76,Player,,,Is this a goo battery?,,

27,95,Player,,,"You got it, boss.",,
27,96,Felix,,,,,
27,97,Player,,,Wanna be in Red Riding Hood?,,
27,98,Felix,"Unless I'm taking an axe to Teddy's face, no. I will not be in that silly play.",,,,

63,1,Felix,"I'm telling you mole-child, I'm Felix!",,,,
63,2,Nugget,Nugget remembers the mean rich boy wearing blue yesterday.,,,,
63,3,Felix,Yes! I was! Teddy switched our clothes! Now will you help me or not?!,,,,
63,4,Nugget,Nugget only cares for green goo.,,,,
63,5,Felix,Fine!<kgwait> Who needs help from a creature like you anyway?!,,,,
63,6,Felix,,,,,
63,7,Felix,"Oh, good! You're here!<kgwait> What did you find out?",,,,
63,8,Player,,,Your dad's birthday is today.,,
63,9,Player,,,Not much really.,,
63,10,Felix,"I see. Well, I doubt whatever help I could call now would even get here before the end of the day. ",,,,
63,11,Player,,,So we're done here?,,
63,12,Felix,Yes...<kgwait> I believe so. I'm afraid your services are no longer needed.<kgwait> You're fired. Begone.,,,,
63,13,Player,,,(Begone.),,
63,14,Felix,It is?!<kgwait> I'll have to fire my secretary.,,,,
63,15,Player,,,So is that the code?,,
63,16,Felix,"Right right. Let me see... <kgwait>yes! It appears that was correct... <kgwait>and Father seems to have saved Chopperton's number for me! Oh, this is excellent! ",,,,
63,17,Player,,,Chopperton?,,
63,18,Felix,He's our family's private pilot. I'm sure he can swing by before the last bell rings.,,,,
63,19,Player,,,I'm sure he can.,,
63,20,Felix,"Hello? Chopperton?<kgwait> It's Felix.<kgwait> Yes, yes I unlocked the phone.<kgwait> I would never forget Father's birthday.",,,,
63,21,Felix,So you'll be here?<kgwait> I see...<kgwait> Meet you on the roof? I suppose I can.<kgwait> A flare?<kgwait> There was no flare in the box!<kgwait> Uh-huh.,,,,
63,22,Felix,"I'll see what I can do about the missiles. It will be done. It'll be two of us, but my guest will be departing... <kgwait>early.<kgwait> Thank you, Chopperton.",,,,
63,23,PlayerCharacter,,,,,
63,24,Felix,Okay then...<kgwait> We have some work to do.,,,,
63,25,Player,,,We do?,,
63,26,Felix,It appears that our courier from earlier pilfered a crucial item that my pilot needs to land. Go get it from him.,,,,
63,27,Player,,,Did you say something about missiles?,,
63,28,Felix,"Well... <kgwait>apparently there's a missile defense system on the roof that will shoot him down if he gets too close. He said to cut the power supply wire, but I'm sure you'll handle that.",,,,
63,29,Player,,,Uh-huh.,,
63,30,Felix,"We'll also need access to the roof, but I'm sure you'll have that sorted out before the next bell rings.",,,,
63,31,Player,,,Yeah. Sure.,,
63,32,Felix,That was fast.<kgwait> Did you successfully retrieve the flare?,,,,
63,33,Player,,,Not yet.,,
63,34,Player,,,He won't give it up.,,
63,35,Felix,I was afraid you'd say that. Time for plan B.,,,,
63,36,Player,,,Which is?,,
63,37,Felix,He seemed rather chuffed about the money the courier gave him.<kgwait> Perhaps I could pretend there's more money for him and while he's distracted you could nab the flare!,,,,
63,38,Player,,,Solid plan.,,
63,39,Felix,Of course it's a brilliant plan. I came up with it.<kgwait> Just be ready to sneak up behind him while we chat.,,,,
63,40,Player,,,Let's do it.,,
63,41,Player,,,Just a sec.,,
63,42,Felix,Well? Are you ready to perpetuate my ingenious ruse?,,,,
63,43,Player,,,Not yet.,,
63,44,Felix,"Good day, custodian.",,,,
63,45,Janitor,Good day? Look at my arm! It's been an okay day at best!,,,,
63,46,Felix,"Uh-<kgwait> right. Right. Yes. It's an 'okay' day.<kgwait> I must say, I was really impressed with your delivery services earlier.",,,,
63,47,Janitor,Is that so?,,,,
63,48,Felix,Absolutely.<kgwait> Perhaps there could be a rather lucrative role for you in my-,,,,
63,49,Janitor,Are you offering me a job?,,,,
63,50,Felix,Well... <kgwait>there will have to be an official interview but I'm fairly certain-,,,,
63,51,Janitor,"I'm gonna stop you there, kid.<kgwait> I'm the JANITOR.<kgwait> I don't do this job for the money. I do it because I love it.",,,,
63,52,Felix,You love cleaning goo puddles off the floor?,,,,
63,53,Janitor,No.<kgwait> I love hitting children with my mop.,,,,
63,54,Felix,,,,,
63,55,Felix,Can-<kgwait> Ow.<kgwait> Can I go to the nurse?,,,,
63,56,Applegate_Lunch,I don't know.<kgwait> Caaaaaaaaaan you?,,,,
63,57,Felix,Great. I'm going. Hopefully she has my blood type on standby.,,,,
63,58,Applegate_Lunch,Toodles!,,,,
63,59,Felix,,,,,
63,60,Felix,Excellent. Here's the phone. See that the invalid gets it. <kgwait>Now I believe you have an appointment with the armless lunatic over there.,,,,
63,61,Player,,,Can't wait.,,
63,62,Felix,,,,,
63,63,Felix,*Ahem.*,,,,
63,64,Player,,,Gesundheit.,,
63,65,Felix,The custodian just left. Did you get the flare before he departed?,,,,
63,66,Player,,,I did not.,,
63,67,Felix,"So you just let him walk out without so much as a ""give me that flare back you decrepit lunatic?""",,,,
63,68,Player,,,Look at Monty.,,
63,69,Player,,,I guess not.,,
63,70,Felix,Yes. I suppose that should have been you.<kgwait> So much for my daring escape.<kgwait> You're fired.,,,,
63,71,Player,,,Aw man.,,
63,72,Felix,We will not be speaking again.,,,,
63,73,Player,,,Oh no.,,
63,74,Felix,So much for my daring escape.<kgwait> You're fired.,,,,
63,75,Felix,I do not speak to terminated employees. Take it up with HR.,,,,
63,76,Player,,,Whatever.,,
63,77,Player,,,What was that about your guest?,,
63,78,Felix,Oh. Nothing really. I just don't like being pressured into business dealings with the uh... <kgwait>physically challenged.,,,,
63,79,Player,,,But I fixed him.,,
63,80,Felix,"Yes, yes. Of course. And you did a wonderful job making him competent enough to help today, but he will NOT be meeting my father.",,,,
63,81,Felix,"I assume if you're here, you've acquired the necessary resources for my departure?",,,,
63,82,Player,,,Still working on that.,,
63,83,Nugget,Nugget only cares for nuggets.,,,,
63,84,Player,,,(Let him brood.),,
63,85,Felix,Worthless school.<kgwait> I can't believe no one is coming to get me.,,,,
63,86,Player,,,(Let him brood.),,
64,0,Player,,,,,
64,1,Felix,I can't believe they have all of us in the same classroom! What happened to the smart class?,,,,
64,2,Player,,,I think this is the smart class.,,
64,3,Felix,You expect me to buy that the mole-child obsessed with nuggets is smart?,,,,
64,4,Player,,,It would be a hard sell.,,
64,5,Felix,Exactly! And you're not exactly solving cold fusion yourself.,,,,
64,6,Player,,,Nope. Bye.,,
64,8,Player,,,This looks like a job for someone else.,,
64,9,Felix,,,,,
64,10,Felix,"No crown, no play. I won't perform until my demands are met.",,,,
64,11,Player,,,"Yeah, yeah.",,
64,12,Felix,So am I getting picked up in the jet or the limo?,,,,
64,13,Player,,,Beats me.,,
64,14,Felix,Beats y-?!<kgwait> You didn't call?!,,,,
64,15,Player,,,Nope.,,
64,16,Felix,Absolutely worthless. Get out of my sight.<kgwait> I'll escape of my own volition!,,,,
64,17,Player,,,You do that.,,
64,18,Felix,Bugger off!<kgwait> You're clearly incapable of helping me escape this wretched institution.,,,,
64,19,Player,,,Clearly.,,
64,20,Player,,,He's just sending a package.,,
64,21,Felix,A package?!<kgwait> What?! No no no!<kgwait> There must be some sort of error-,,,,
64,22,Felix,,,,,
64,23,Felix,What? Father trusted you as his courier?,,,,
64,24,Janitor,"Yeah, some guy just came by and gave me more than I make in a month to give this to you.",,,,
64,25,Felix,"*Sigh*<kgwait> Great. Just great.<kgwait> That will be all, custodian.",,,,
64,26,Janitor,"<wiggle>tHaT wIlL bE aLl CuStOdIaN.</wiggle><kgwait> If I wasn't just paid enough to buy fifty mops, you'd be on the receiving end of this one. Stupid brat.",,,,
64,27,Felix,,,,,
64,28,Teacher,<wave>I love a good surprise delivery!<kgwait><br>Are you sure that package isn't for me?</wave>,,,,
64,29,Felix,What? Of course it's not for you!<kgwait> Father sent this to help me escape this foul excuse of a school.,,,,
64,30,Teacher,"<wave>Your father? What-<kgwait> Um- Of course! Oh, what to do!<kgwait><br>Here come the tears...<kgwait> Uh-<kgwait> Dilly dilly doo!",,,,
64,31,Felix,,,,,
64,32,Felix,Well... <kgwait>that was odd.,,,,
64,33,Felix,Let's see how Father intends for me to leave this place.,,,,
64,34,Felix,Aha!<kgwait> A phone! And it appears there's a note. I knew Father wouldn't abandon me!,,,,
64,35,Felix,Hmmm... there appears to be a passcode. Why would Father send me a locked phone?,,,,
64,36,Monty,*Ahem*<kgwait> Perhaps I may be of service.,,,,
64,37,Felix,"Not now, cripple. I'm trying to figure out how to unlock this device.",,,,
64,38,Monty,Yeah. Hey. About that. READ THE NOTE.,,,,
64,39,Felix,"Oh, well... <kgwait>I'm not exactly the best reader. My skills lie more in-",,,,
64,40,Monty,Ted-<kgwait> I mean Felix.<kgwait> I can read. Just promise to give me the phone after you're done with it and I'll help you unlock it.<kgwait> Deal?,,,,
64,41,Felix,Fine. If you must. What does the note say?,,,,
64,42,Monty,"Let's see here...<kgwait> Uh-huh.<kgwait> Oh, that's easy.<kgwait> The code is your dad's birthday.",,,,
64,43,Felix,Oh... <kgwait>this may be a tinge more difficult than I thought.,,,,
64,44,Monty,"You-<kgwait> you don't know his birthday, do you?",,,,
64,45,Felix,It's never been that important!,,,,
64,46,Monty,Well it is now! Looks like money can't buy you a brain! How are we gonna unlock this thing now?,,,,
64,47,Davey,Did you guys see that?,,,,
64,48,Player,,,See what?,,
64,49,Davey,Ms. Lovelett... <kgwait>she messed up a rhyme and ran out of here crying.,,,,
64,50,Felix,Who cares about her?<kgwait> We have bigger problems.,,,,
64,51,Davey,I dunno. I haven't seen her mess up a rhyme since her husband left. Something about that box really upset her.,,,,
64,52,Felix,Would you go away?<kgwait> We're busy!,,,,
64,53,Davey,"Okay. Whatever, peasant.",,,,
64,54,Felix,As I was saying-,,,,
64,55,Monty,Hang on.<kgwait> That weird kid is right. Something about the box made her upset. She thought it was for her!,,,,
64,56,Felix,Who cares?!,,,,
64,57,Monty,Maybe she knows something about your dad's company? Or your dad? Something is up with her.,,,,
64,58,Felix,Ugh. Fine.<kgwait> Errand boy! Please fetch the teacher and see what set her off about this box.,,,,
64,59,Player,,,This is fun.,,
64,60,Felix,So what did she say?,,,,
64,61,Player,,,I haven't talked to her yet.,,
64,62,Player,,,She's crying in a bathroom stall.,,
64,63,Felix,And?,,,,
64,64,Player,,,She won't come out.,,
64,65,Felix,I don't care! Find a way to get her out! Apparently she knows something about this box or phone or- SHE JUST KNOWS SOMETHING!,,,,
64,66,Player,,,Okay okay.,,
64,67,Player,,,"""Help! Help! I'm on fire!""",,
64,68,Felix,What are you talking about? Why would she say that?,,,,
64,69,Player,,,Cause she was on fire.,,
64,70,Felix,And she's not anymore?,,,,
64,71,Player,,,You bet.,,
64,72,Felix,And she told you the passcode to the phone?,,,,
64,73,Player,,,She locked herself in the other classroom.,,
64,74,Felix,Then get into the other classroom and ask her what she knows! You're being more obtuse than Teddy!,,,,
64,75,Player,,,I miss him.,,
64,76,Felix,No you don't. You like working for me. Now get going.,,,,
64,77,Player,,,Get going.,,
64,78,Felix,I don't want to hear another word out of you unless it has something to do with this phone.,,,,
64,79,Player,,,(Say nothing.),,
64,80,Monty,"And... <kgwait>when you leave, you take me with you and introduce me to your father. I have a business proposal for him.",,,,
64,81,Felix,"Yes, yes. Whatever you want. Just read the note!",,,,
64,82,Felix,,,,,
64,83,Felix,My word!<kgwait> What is that fiendish contraption above you?,,,,
64,84,Player,,,A killer robot.,,
64,85,Felix,It looks quite nefarious. Do you think Dr. Danner had a hand in making it?,,,,
64,86,Player,,,I don't know.,,
64,87,Felix,"Well, it looks dirty.<kgwait> Keep it away from me.",,,,
64,88,Player,,,If you insist.,,
64,89,Felix,"I'm glad you're rid of that filthy automaton, but I'm not interested in speaking to someone of your... status.",,,,
64,90,Player,,,Nor I to you.,,
64,91,Player,,,I got it.,,
64,92,Felix,"Oh, splendid.<kgwait> Do hold on to it for a moment.<kgwait> I'll retrieve it at the time of the show.",,,,
64,93,Player,,,"Whatever, Your Majesty.",,
64,94,Felix,Just polish that crown for me until the show.<kgwait> I'll retrieve it at curtain call.,,,,
65,0,Player,,,,,
65,1,Nugget,Nugget is feeling conflicted.,,,,
65,2,Player,,,What are you conflicted about?,,
65,3,Player,,,(Let him feel conflicted.),,
65,4,Nugget,Nugget is having strange... <kgwait>cravings.,,,,
65,5,Player,,,Cravings?,,
65,6,Nugget,"Yes. Normally Nugget only craves Nugget's nuggets, but today Nugget has had goo and now Nugget craves...",,,,
65,7,Player,,,More goo?,,
65,8,Nugget,Flesh.,,,,
65,9,Player,,,Uh oh.,,
65,10,Nugget,"Yes, Nugget is also concerned. Perhaps Nugget's recent transformation has something to do with it.",,,,
65,11,Player,,,Want me to help?,,
65,12,Player,,,Good luck with that.,,
65,13,Nugget,,,,,
65,14,Nugget,Nugget is feeling funny again!,,,,
65,16,Nugget,Nugget feels better!<kgwait> Nugget requires more goo!,,,,
65,20,Player,,,Wanna be in another play?,,
65,21,Nugget,"If Nugget can have more goo. Nugget sees a puddle by the janitor, but the janitor refuses to allow Nugget to have it.",,,,
65,22,Player,,,I'll see what I can do.,,
65,23,Nugget,,,,,
65,24,Nugget,,,,,
65,25,Nugget,More goo! More goo!,,,,
65,26,Player,,,(Let him enjoy his goo.),,
65,27,Player,,,Wanna be in another play?,,
65,28,Nugget,Yes! Yes! The goo gives Nugget the strength to perform!,,,,
65,29,Player,,,Cool. See you at recess.,,
65,30,Nugget,Nugget's other arm has changed! Nugget feels weird!,,,,
65,31,Player,,,That doesn't surprise me.,,
65,32,Nugget,Help Nugget with what?,,,,
65,33,Player,,,The goo cravings.,,
65,34,Player,,,*Sigh* Nevermind.,,
65,35,Nugget,Should Nugget not have the cravings?,,,,
65,36,Nugget,"""Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavory guide!""<kgwait> Nugget does not like unsavory.<kgwait> Nugget likes his nuggets savory.",,,,
65,37,Player,,,I don't think Romeo is eating nuggets.,,
65,38,Nugget,Then Nugget thinks this Romeo is a fool.,,,,
65,39,Player,,,You're probably right.,,
65,40,Nugget,Nugget demands room to act!,,,,
65,41,Nugget,,,,,
65,42,Applegate_Lunch,Okay. Let me just move these trays-,,,,
65,43,Applegate_Lunch,Or you could just kick them. I don't care. I'm only a lunch lady for a few more minutes.,,,,
65,44,Teacher,<wave>Now to set the scene! Romeo thinks Juliet is dead and he's weeping!<kgwait><br>But she's actually alive! She's just peacefully sleeping!</wave>,,,,
65,45,Nugget,"Ah, dear pretty Lily. Why art thou so pretty?",,,,
65,46,Teacher,<wave>*Ahem* Please don't forget!<kgwait><br>Her name is Juliet!</wave>,,,,
65,47,Nugget,Oh yes!<kgwait> Nugget is in a play. Nugget is Romeo and the pretty Lily is Juliet.,,,,
65,48,Nugget,As Romeo was saying...<kgwait> Eyes look your last! And arms that were once claws take your last embrace!,,,,
65,49,Nugget,"And lips! Romeo would like a kiss on the lips, but Romeo shouldn't do that cause Juliet is sleep-<kgwait> dead.<kgwait> The pretty Juliet is dead.",,,,
65,50,Nugget,So Nug-<kgwait> Romeo will just kiss the pretty Juliet upon the forehead.,,,,
65,51,Teacher,,,,,
65,52,Nugget,Hehehe.<kgwait> Nugget got to kiss the pretty Lily's forehead.,,,,
65,53,Lily,"Get on with it, ROMEO.",,,,
65,54,Nugget,Oh yes.<kgwait> *Ahem* Romeo is so sad! Uh... <kgwait>Romeo will drink poison because he is so sad.,,,,
65,55,Teacher,<wave>*Sigh* This was going so well. I would opine.<kgwait><br>But I think that kiss made him forget his line!,,,,
65,56,Nugget,Romeo... <kgwait>uh... <kgwait>doth declare... <kgwait>uh... <kgwait>Romeo's tummy hurts.,,,,
65,57,Teacher,,,,,
65,58,Teacher,"<wave>With Romeo dead, Juliet is soon to recover.<kgwait><br>She awakens to see her now deceased lover!</wave>",,,,
65,59,PlayerCharacter,,,,,
65,60,Lily,"*Sigh*<kgwait> Oh, dear Romeo.<kgwait> Poison hath been your timeless end. Guess I better stab myself.",,,,
65,61,Teacher,<wave>I don't appreciate your acting ways!<kgwait><br>I prefer if you didn't paraphrase!</wave>,,,,
65,62,Lily,*Sigh*<kgwait> I will kiss thy forehead in hopes that some poison doth hang on thy face.,,,,
65,63,Teacher,,,,,
65,64,Nugget,Hehehe.<kgwait> Nugget got a kiss from the pretty Lily.,,,,
65,65,Lily,"You're dead, Romeo!<kgwait> *Ahem*<kgwait> O, happy dagger! This is thy sheath. There rust and let me die.",,,,
65,66,Nugget,,,,,
65,67,Lily,,,,,
65,68,Lily,"Oh, my heart.<kgwait> Oh, the pain.<kgwait> I'm totally dying.<kgwait> Ugh. Ah.",,,,
65,69,Teacher,"<wave>Oh, I love an authentic recreation!<kgwait><br>The blood and the death! You deserve a standing ovation!</wave>",,,,
65,70,Nugget,Romeo is starting to feel very very bad.,,,,
65,71,Teacher,<wave>Well yes. Drinking poison was a requirement for your part.<kgwait><br>Actors are known to suffer for their art!,,,,
65,72,Nugget,So... <kgwait>Nugget- *gugh*<kgwait> Nugget doesn't have study hall?,,,,
65,73,Teacher,"<wave>Yes! Correct! No study hall today!<kgwait><br>If you can live through the poison, you can go out and play.</wave>",,,,
65,74,Nugget,*gugh*<kgwait> This thrills Nugget.,,,,
65,75,Teacher,"<wave>Now that dinner theater is done, I think I need,<kgwait><br>To finish lunch in the library. I'm gonna go read!</wave>",,,,
65,76,Nugget,,,,,
65,77,Nugget,,,,,
65,78,Nugget,Nugget feels like his insides are being cooked like nuggets!,,,,
65,79,Player,,,It looks painful.,,
65,80,Nugget,Nugget agrees! Nugget thinks this is quite painful. Nugget wishes he had remembered not to drink the poison.,,,,
65,81,Player,,,That would have been smart.,,
65,82,Nugget,"Yes, but smartness is not Nugget's strong suit.",,,,
65,83,Player,,,No it is not.,,
65,84,Nugget,Has Nugget's goo-removing friend figured out a way to prevent Nugget's demise?,,,,
65,85,Player,,,I'm still working on that.,,
65,86,Nugget,Has Nugget's goo-removing friend figured out a way to prevent Nugget's demise?,,,,
65,87,Player,,,I'm still working on that.,,
65,88,Player,,,Drink this.,,
65,89,Nugget,What is this strange liquid?,,,,
65,91,Player,,,Why are you asking?,,
65,92,Nugget,Drinking strange liquids are what- *gugh*<kgwait> -what got Nugget into this mess so forgive Nugget for being suspicious!,,,,
65,93,Player,,,It's an antidote.,,
65,94,Nugget,Very well. Nugget will drink the drink.,,,,
65,95,Player,,,Good.,,
65,96,Player,,,Good.,,
65,97,Nugget,Study hall.<kgwait> Goo.<kgwait> No pretty Lily kiss.<kgwait> No Nugget Cave of Love.<kgwait> It has been a very bad day for Nugget.,,,,
65,98,Player,,,I agree.,,
65,99,Nugget,Nugget is feeling better!<kgwait> This drink has saved Nugget's life!,,,,
65,100,Player,,,That's good.,,
65,101,Nugget,Nugget does not feel any different.<kgwait> Nugget feels the cold embrace of death. Cold like bad nuggets.<kgwait> *gugh*<kgwait> Cold-,,,,
65,102,Player,,,Nugget?,,

65,107,Nugget,Nugget feels the goo cure coursing through his veins!<kgwait> Nugget understands the goo now.,,,,
65,108,Player,,,You do?,,
65,109,Player,,,"That's great, Nugget.",,
65,110,Nugget,Yes!<kgwait> Nugget hears the goo. Nugget will demonstrate at recess.,,,,

66,1,Applegate_Lunch,The principal just called and said he wants to see Alice in his office!<kgwait> Which one of you kids is Alice?,,,,
66,2,Alice,Huh?<kgwait> What'd I do?,,,,
66,3,Alice,,,,,
66,4,Alice,Hmmm... <kgwait>I don't think it happened here.,,,,
66,5,Player,,,What happened?,,
66,6,Applegate_Lunch,He didn't say. Just get out of here!,,,,
66,7,Alice,Ummm...<kgwait> okay I guess.,,,,
66,8,Applegate_Lunch,,,,,
66,9,Regis,Attention! Please send Alice to the principal's office! Alice to the principal's office immediately! Thank you!,,,,
66,10,Alice,Huh?<kgwait> That's weird. I didn't do anything. I guess I better get going.,,,,
66,11,Alice,"Good, you're here. Let's go see Mr. Scippio.",,,,
66,12,Player,,,How are we getting there?,,
66,13,Austin,I can throw a burger at the lunch lady!<kgwait> I love throwing stuff!,,,,
66,14,Alice,Let's hold off on the throwing things. We don't want you to get study hall again.,,,,
66,15,Austin,Aw man.<kgwait> So how do I distract her?,,,,
66,16,Alice,You could just... <kgwait>talk to her.,,,,
66,17,Austin,Oh yeah. That could work.,,,,
66,18,Alice,"Cool. Get on that. Let's go, kid.",,,,
66,19,Player,,,Right behind you.,,
66,20,Alice,Scippio wouldn't open the door. I'm gonna try again during recess.,,,,
66,21,Player,,,If you say so.,,
66,22,Alice,Our next step has to be inspecting the slide. We'll just wait until the bell rings.,,,,
66,23,Player,,,You're gonna get called to the office.,,
66,25,Alice,What? Why?,,,,
66,26,Player,,,Regis is gonna drop you in a pit.,,

66,28,Player,,,More or less.,,
66,29,Alice,"Well, I should probably start planning my escape then.",,,,
66,30,Player,,,Scippio said you have to go.,,
66,31,Alice,So what? You expect me to just get dropped down a pit?,,,,
66,32,Player,,,I'm gonna cut the power.,,
66,33,Alice,"Ugh...<kgwait> This isn't great. Okay. I'll see if I can get Regis talking before he tries to drop me, but you better make sure whatever he's trying to do doesn't work!",,,,
66,34,Player,,,I'm on it.,,
66,35,Alice,You better cut the power before I get called into the office.,,,,
66,36,Player,,,Can do.,,
66,37,Player,,,You should take this.,,
66,38,Alice,Woah... <kgwait>something about this thing makes me feel weird. I don't want it.,,,,
66,39,Player,,,Suit yourself.,,
66,40,Alice,But maybe try to be hidden in the office with it when I get called in.,,,,
66,41,Player,,,Good idea.,,
66,42,Austin,What?!<kgwait> He can't do that!,,,,
66,43,Austin,Yeah! We gotta get you out of here!,,,,
66,44,Applegate_Lunch,Hang on one second Carla.<kgwait> Hey!<kgwait> The principal just called and said he wants to see Alice in his office!<kgwait> Which one of you kids is Alice?,,,,

67,5,Player,,,Good idea.,,
67,6,Davey,,,,,
67,7,Davey,Good work helping me get that axe out of the case.<kgwait> Now we just gotta grab it before that janitor disposes of her body.,,,,
67,8,Player,,,How do we do that?,,
67,9,Davey,He's likely dragging her to the pit that opens up in the office. We gotta stop him before he can drop her in.,,,,
67,10,Player,,,Okay.,,
67,11,Davey,"The control module for the trap door is in the janitor's closet, but we're gonna need something sharp to cut the wires.",,,,
67,12,Player,,,Any ideas?,,

67,25,Player,,,How?,,
67,26,Davey,How should I know?<kgwait> You've known him longer than me!<kgwait> Isn't there someone from your other school who can get rid of him?,,,,
67,27,Player,,,Maybe there is.,,
67,28,Davey,What happened?!<kgwait> Where were you?!,,,,
67,29,Player,,,I kinda forgot.,,

67,34,Davey,She's doomed.,,,,
67,35,Player,,,What do you mean?,,
67,36,Davey,Do you see a giant axe?!<kgwait> That's the only thing Linda said could kill him!,,,,
67,37,Player,,,We can still get it.,,
67,38,Davey,No we can't!<kgwait> It's still chained up in the classroom and the teacher only lets me take it when we're doing a play! It's over! We failed! I'll just have to fight that janitor the old-fashioned way.,,,,
67,39,Player,,,Bummer.,,
67,40,Player,,,Where is it?,,
67,41,Davey,The teacher put it back on the wall and chained it up. We can't get it now!,,,,
67,42,Player,,,So we failed?,,
67,43,Davey,Yeah. I guess I'll just have to fight that janitor the old-fashioned way.,,,,
67,44,Davey,"Ms. Lovelett, my tummy really hurts and I think if I don't leave right now I'm gonna THROW UP!!",,,,
67,45,Teacher,<wave>Oh my! That's awful! Get out of here! Leave!<kgwait><br>Go to the nurse before you heave!</wave>,,,,

68,6,Emmy,She took my lunch. They only make one salad a day.<kgwait> I'm so hungry.,,,,
68,7,Player,,,Can we make a new salad?,,
68,8,Emmy,Hmmm... <kgwait>Maybe?<kgwait> I have some extra carrots. There are some veggies on the burgers. If you get three of them that should be plenty.,,,,
68,9,Player,,,I can do that.,,
68,10,Emmy,"Yeah, I guess that would be fine. I'd prefer not to eat food that's touched meat, but beggars can't be choosers I guess.",,,,
68,13,Player,,,I'll get started.,,
68,17,Emmy,How's the veggie hunt going?<kgwait> My tummy is starting to hurt.,,,,

68,26,Player,,,Okay.,,
68,27,Player,,,I got you those burgers.,,
68,28,Emmy,*Phew*<kgwait> Thanks. The meat looks really dry so none of the juices should have gotten on the veggies.<kgwait> At least I won't starve.,,,,
68,29,Player,,,That's good.,,
68,30,Emmy,Yeah.<kgwait> You've been a really good friend to me today.<kgwait> Come meet me on the playground. I want to give you some beautiful red flowers from my garden.,,,,

72,31,Austin,,,,,
72,32,Cindy,I can't believe Potato Patty is already tapping out. You just can't torture girls like you used to.,,,,

73,22,Felix,"If I give you a dollar, will you go away?",,,,
73,23,Cindy,"I mean... a dollar won't hurt them the way I want, but maybe I can pay someone to do it for me.",,,,
73,24,Felix,Fine.<kgwait> Here. Now go away.,,,,
73,25,Cindy,"Thanks, sweetie!",,,,
73,26,Cindy,,,,,
73,27,Cindy,No... no... no. None of these will do!,,,,

73,29,Player,,,I really don't want to talk to Cindy.,,
73,30,Cindy,"I'm looking for a nice big rock to bludgeon those girls with, but I can't find a good one.",,,,
73,31,Player,,,Use this instead.,,
73,32,Cindy,Oh my gosh! That's perfect!<kgwait> Gimme gimme!,,,,

73,35,Player,,,Thanks.,,
73,36,Cindy,Those girls are in for a rude awaken-<kgwait> HEY! This is just one of those walky things the dorky hall monitor was using!,,,,
73,37,Player,,,A crutch?,,
73,38,Player,,,Good luck with that.,,
73,39,Cindy,I can't believe you thought I would want this stupid walky thing.<kgwait> What do you take me for?!,,,,
73,41,Cindy,This is what I think about you<kgwait> and your<kgwait> stupid<kgwait> blue<kgwait> flowers!,,,,
73,42,Cindy,Now give me the red ones!,,,,
73,43,Cindy,,,,,
73,44,Cindy,I'll be taking these. You can never have too much of other people's things!,,,,
73,45,Emmy,Fine. Go ahead.,,,,
73,46,Cindy,"Hey!<kgwait> What gives, Flowerless Fiona?<kgwait> Aren't you gonna cry?",,,,

73,49,Emmy,Be my guest.,,,,
73,50,Cindy,"Okay, now it's not as much fun. Whatever. I'm gonna go bother someone else.",,,,
73,51,Cindy,,,,,
73,52,Cindy,I can't believe she's not crying anymore! What gives?,,,,

73,58,Cindy,Everyone at this school is terrible. I hate it here.,,,,
73,59,Player,,,Me too.,,
73,60,Player,,,I'm not gonna answer that.,,
73,61,Cindy,I can't believe she didn't even put up a fight. These red flowers just aren't filling the void.,,,,
73,62,Player,,,I think you broke her.,,
73,63,Cindy,Did I?<kgwait> Wow.<kgwait> Lily normally took twice as long. The girls at this school are weak.,,,,
73,64,Player,,,(I really don't want to talk to Cindy anymore.),,
73,65,Cindy,I can't believe I have to settle for red flowers. What a joke this school is.,,,,
73,66,Player,,,There there.,,
73,67,Cindy,There really aren't enough other girls around here to torture.,,,,
73,68,Player,,,You need help.,,
73,69,Cindy,Don't tell me how to deal with my problems!<kgwait> Go away!,,,,

74,12,Player,,,Break a leg Nugget.,,
74,13,Nugget,,,,,
74,14,Nugget,Nugget is disappointed.,,,,
74,15,Player,,,Why?,,
74,16,Nugget,"Nugget was promised more goo, but Nugget was deceived.",,,,
74,17,Player,,,I can still get you goo.,,
74,18,Nugget,It is too late. Nugget cannot reach his final form now.,,,,
74,19,Player,,,Bummer.,,

74,37,Player,,,"Good for you, Nugget.",,
74,38,Nugget,Nugget hears things. Whispers.,,,,
74,39,Player,,,Like what?,,
74,40,Nugget,"Nugget can hear the goo. The bird, the bunny... <kgwait>and Kevin.",,,,

74,62,Nugget,AAAAAAHHH!!<kgwait> Nugget does not like the goo puppy!,,,,
74,63,Austin,"Nice shot, kid!<kgwait> Way better than a stupid rock. I'm gonna go get Alice!",,,,
74,64,Player,,,Good luck.,,
74,65,Nugget,Nugget has never been more scared of a puppy in his young life!,,,,
74,66,Player,,,"Yeah, that thing is gross.",,
74,67,Nugget,Hehehe...<kgwait> Nugget knows a secret.,,,,
74,68,Player,,,What secret?,,
74,69,Player,,,I don't care.,,
74,70,Nugget,Nugget can hear things. Nugget hears the goo. Nugget can speak with Birdy.,,,,
74,71,Player,,,What's it saying?,,
74,72,Nugget,Nugget has just informed the bird about the fake principal man. The bird resents little children... <kgwait>but now resents the fake principal man even more.,,,,
74,73,Player,,,Interesting.,,
74,74,Nugget,"Stop, Birdy! Nugget beseeches you!",,,,
74,75,Nugget,,,,,
74,76,Nugget,"Yes, yes. Nugget remembers.<kgwait> Good times.<kgwait> But look!<kgwait> Nugget's claw is gone!<kgwait> Nugget is cured!",,,,
74,77,PlayerCharacter,,,,,
74,78,Nugget,"Nugget agrees to Birdy's terms.<kgwait> Thank you, gracious Birdy.",,,,
74,79,PlayerCharacter,,,,,
74,80,Nugget,We're good.,,,,
74,81,Player,,,We are?,,
74,82,Nugget,"Birdy has agreed to help us, but more importantly, has agreed to not remove our small intestines.",,,,
74,83,Player,,,That's good.,,
74,84,Nugget,"Yes, Nugget is a good negotiator. Birdy merely requests that we cure Kevin and use the cure on Birdy tomorrow.",,,,
74,85,Player,,,Ummm... okay.,,
74,86,Lily,"*Psssst!*<kgwait> Hey, guys!<kgwait> Over here!",,,,
74,87,Nugget,Pretty Lily!<kgwait> Nugget is happy to see you again!,,,,
74,88,Lily,"Yeah, I'm just happy to be alive. I was marking the spot for you to dig, when that crazy bird tried to kill me!<kgwait> But I see that's not gonna be a problem anymore.",,,,
74,89,Nugget,Yes. Nugget has worked out a deal with Birdy.,,,,
74,90,Lily,"Great. So all we need now is a shovel and nuggets. I remember seeing a shovel by the tree, but where can we get nuggets?",,,,
74,91,Nugget,Birdy informed Nugget that there are nuggets on the roof. Birdy offered a one-way trip there if we so request.,,,,
74,92,Lily,Ummm... okay.<kgwait> I guess we'll figure that out.<kgwait> Let's start with the shovel and go from there.,,,,
74,93,Player,,,Good idea.,,
74,94,Lily,I'm gonna stay hidden.<kgwait> I don't want the stage psycho over there to realize I faked my own death in there.,,,,
74,95,Player,,,Fair enough.,,
74,96,Nugget,Nugget will begin preparing the site of the Nugget Cave of Love. Please bring Nugget the shovel.,,,,
74,97,Player,,,I'm on it.,,
74,106,Nugget,Hmmm... <kgwait>Yes. The pretty Lily has quite the eye for Nugget Cave of Love digging sites.,,,,
74,107,Player,,,Here's that shovel.,,
74,108,Player,,,It looks great.,,
74,109,Nugget,Ah yes!<kgwait> Nugget can start digging now. It may take a moment. Nugget is used to digging in sandboxes.,,,,
74,110,Player,,,Don't those have bottoms?,,
74,111,Nugget,Nugget does not understand the point.,,,,
74,112,Player,,,Nevermind. What should I do?,,
74,113,Player,,,What should I do?,,
74,114,Nugget,"Nugget's goo-removing, poison-curing friend should consult with Birdy. Birdy will bring you to the nuggets.",,,,
74,115,Player,,,I guess I will.,,
74,116,Nugget,Birdy also knows where nuggets are and will take any of Nugget's friends to them upon request.,,,,
74,117,Player,,,That's nifty.,,
74,118,Nugget,Oh!<kgwait> Nugget almost forgot! You will need Nugget's special Nugget Bag!<sup>TM</sup>,,,,
74,119,Player,,,Nugget Bag<sup>TM</sup>?,,
74,120,Nugget,Yes!<kgwait> It's how Nugget transports his vast quantities of nuggets!<kgwait> Please do not lose it!<kgwait> It has been passed down for generations of Nuggets.,,,,
74,121,Player,,,It smells funny.,,
74,122,Nugget,Nugget likes the smell.,,,,
74,123,Player,,,I'm gonna go then.,,
74,124,Nugget,Yes! Return with nuggets!,,,,
74,125,Player,,,(Return with nuggets.),,
74,126,Nugget,Nugget's goo-ridding poison-curing friend should go get nuggets. Birdy knows where they are!,,,,
74,127,Player,,,Oh yeah.,,
74,128,Nugget,It is raining nuggets! Just like Nugget's homeland!<kgwait> What a wonderful day this has been.,,,,
74,129,Lily,"It's not over yet, Nugget.<kgwait> We got a kid to save-",,,,
74,130,Teacher,<wave>What's this? You're here?! I've been misled!<kgwait><br>You died in the play! You're supposed to be dead!</wave>,,,,
74,131,Lily,"Okay! It's time to go! Move it, Nugget! I don't want to actually stab myself!",,,,
74,132,Nugget,Yes. Nugget will happily dive into the nuggets! WEEEEEEE!!!,,,,
74,133,Lily,,,,,
74,134,Player,,,Here's that shovel.,,
74,135,Nugget,What do you expect Nugget to do with this?,,,,
74,136,Player,,,Dig a Nugget Cave?,,
74,137,Nugget,Nugget is not a miracle worker!<kgwait> Nugget cannot dig the Nugget Cave super duper fast! Nugget needed the shovel earlier!,,,,
74,138,Player,,,Oh.,,
74,139,Nugget,Now Nugget cannot dig!<kgwait> It is too late for Nugget! <kgwait>Nugget is sad!,,,,
74,140,Player,,,My bad.,,
74,141,Nugget,"Yes, yes.<kgwait> The Nugget Cave of Love is coming along. Nugget's goo-removing, poison-curing friend should be getting Nugget's nuggets.",,,,
74,142,Player,,,Working on it.,,
74,143,Nugget,Nugget is almost finished with his work. Then it is time for nuggets.<kgwait> Do you have the nuggets?,,,,
74,144,Nugget,"Nugget is finished!<kgwait> Does Nugget's goo-removing, poison-curing friend have the nuggets?",,,,
74,145,Player,,,Nope.,,
74,146,Nugget,So Nugget didn't dig a Nugget Cave of Love... he dug a regular cave of despair.,,,,
74,147,Player,,,If you want to be dramatic about it.,,
74,148,Nugget,Nugget feels he's earned a little drama!<kgwait> Nugget is very upset!,,,,
74,149,Lily,It's okay Nugget. At least the hole is dug. We'll get the nuggets tomorrow. Today was a good day.,,,,
74,150,Player,,,It was?,,
74,151,Lily,I mean... <kgwait>no. Not really. But we still got pretty far. Hopefully tomorrow we can actually save Kevin.,,,,
74,152,Player,,,So what now?,,
74,153,Lily,I'm gonna wait here until the bell rings. I don't trust anyone who rhymes with that much enthusiasm.,,,,
74,154,Player,,,Good idea.,,
74,155,Nugget,Nugget is still very upset that he did not get to dig a Nugget Cave of Love.<kgwait> Nugget deserved better.,,,,
74,156,Player,,,"Yes, you did.",,
74,157,Nugget,*Phew*<kgwait> Nugget is done! Nugget's friend should come see the Nugget Cave of Love!!,,,,
74,158,Player,,,(Go see.),,
74,159,Nugget,Good! The fake principal man is gone!<kgwait> Now please help Nugget with the bad puppy. Nugget feels his arms coming off!,,,,
74,160,Player,,,I'll think of something.,,
74,161,Nugget,Nugget is free!<kgwait> Now Nugget frees Booboo from the goo!,,,,
74,162,PlayerCharacter,,,,,
74,163,Nugget,"The Booboo is free of the goo! Come, bunnies! Nugget will save you too!",,,,
74,164,Nugget,,,,,
74,165,Nugget,Nugget thinks his arm is coming off!,,,,
74,166,PlayerCharacter,,,,,
74,167,Nugget,Ow.<kgwait> Bad doggie.,,,,
74,168,Nugget,,,,,
74,169,Nugget,Of course Nugget's arm tastes good!<kgwait> Did you think Nugget would taste bad?!,,,,
74,170,PlayerCharacter,,,,,
74,171,Nugget,NUGGET'S GOO-CURING FRIEND SHOULD RUN!! THE BAD BOOBOO WANTS MORE ARMS!!,,,,
74,172,Player,,,Uh oh.,,
74,173,Nugget,"Nugget releases you, cute bunnies, from the goo!",,,,
74,174,Nugget,,,,,
74,175,Nugget,"Be still, Nugget's heart. The pretty Lily is here...",,,,
74,176,Player,,,"That's great, Nugget.",,
74,177,Player,,,Do it.,,
74,178,Nugget,Well...<kgwait> Nugget WOULD have spoken to Birdy...<kgwait> if Birdy didn't just fly away.,,,,
74,179,Player,,,Oh.,,
74,180,Nugget,"Yes, perhaps Nugget will show his animal powers to you another day.",,,,
74,181,Player,,,Perhaps.,,
75,0,Player,,,,,
75,1,Emmy,,,,,
75,2,Emmy,Gotta water these beans.<kgwait> Don't want them to dry up on us.,,,,
75,3,Player,,,The flowers on the playground...,,
75,4,Emmy,"Oh, hello! What about them?",,,,
75,5,Player,,,(Let her water the plants.),,
75,6,Player,,,I'm making a bouquet.,,
75,7,Emmy,How lovely! There are so many in bloom right now! I wouldn't mind if you plucked a few... but...,,,,
75,8,Player,,,But what?,,
75,9,Emmy,I would only take the red ones if I were you. The blue ones are a special hybrid I made that are slightly... <kgwait>deadly.,,,,
75,10,Player,,,Got it.,,
75,12,Player,,,You made poisonous flowers?,,
75,13,Emmy,It was an accident! It's not my fault that the soil is weird around here with all the goo!,,,,
75,14,Emmy,"Stupid nasty girl.<kgwait> Don't worry, my babies.<kgwait> I won't let her get you.",,,,
75,15,Player,,,Are you okay?,,
75,16,Player,,,I'm not gonna get involved.,,
75,17,Emmy,"*sniff* Huh?<kgwait> Oh, it's you again.<kgwait> Yeah, I'll be okay. I'm just tending to my last bean sprouts here since that little thistle ruined my garden outside.",,,,
75,18,Player,,,Good luck with that.,,
75,19,Emmy,Excuse me! Please don't touch my bean sprouts! I'm working very hard to keep them alive.,,,,
75,20,Player,,,Okay.,,
75,21,Player,,,What's that you're holding?,,
75,22,Emmy,This? It's a watering can. It's pretty heavy.,,,,
75,23,Player,,,Can I have it?,,
75,24,Emmy,No.<kgwait>,,,,
75,25,Player,,,Fair enough.,,
75,26,Emmy,But she took it from me! How am I supposed to keep the plants-,,,,
75,27,Teacher,<wave>Emmy dear... <kgwait>I don't really care.<kgwait><br>You're just going to have to learn to share!</wave>,,,,
75,28,Player,,,(Walk away.),,
75,29,Emmy,I can't believe it! Someone took my watering can! My poor bean sprouts are gonna dry up!,,,,
75,30,Player,,,Oh no.,,
75,31,Emmy,Please don't touch my bean sprouts! They're very vulnerable since someone took my watering can!,,,,
75,32,Emmy,,,,,
75,46,Emmy,I think this is the right book...,,,,
75,47,Player,,,I hope so.,,
75,48,Emmy,"Hey, Ms. Lovelett.<kgwait> I'm having a bad day.<kgwait> Could we do Jack and the Beanstalk? I already have the book.",,,,
75,49,Teacher,"<wave>Oh, Jack and the Beanstalk is always such fun!<kgwait><br>But we need a beanstalk to do this one!</wave>",,,,
75,50,Emmy,I know. I know. I have someone working on that part right now.,,,,

75,56,Player,,,Got it.,,
75,57,Emmy,Darn it. There's gotta be some around here somewhere.,,,,
75,58,Player,,,I'll keep looking.,,
75,59,Emmy,It's so tall!<kgwait> Maybe there is something to using goo for plants.<kgwait> You should get up there while you can!,,,,
75,60,Player,,,Good idea.,,
75,61,Emmy,,,,,
75,62,Player,,,I got them.,,
75,63,Player,,,Not yet.,,
75,64,Emmy,Good!<kgwait> Um... <kgwait>they are extremely deadly if they're not washed. Would you mind doing that for me?,,,,
75,65,Player,,,Sure.,,
75,66,Player,,,Why don't you go?,,
75,67,Emmy,"She only lets people out who are in her plays or helping to set them up.<kgwait> You're her little star right now, so she should give you a pass.",,,,
75,68,Player,,,I guess I'll get going.,,
75,69,Player,,,I already did.,,

75,82,Player,,,Is that so?,,
75,83,Emmy,Yeah! The nurse gave me some wonderful pills. Would you like one? I don't think I'll need another. I feel funny.,,,,
75,84,Player,,,I would!,,
75,85,Player,,,No thanks.,,
75,86,Emmy,Okie dokie. Lemme know if you change your mind.,,,,

75,93,Emmy,Oh. Just wanted to make sure you knew.<kgwait> I would want to know.,,,,
75,94,Player,,,Thanks.,,
75,95,Emmy,"You don't suppose it might pose a threat to my plants, do you?",,,,
75,96,Player,,,It poses a threat to me.,,
75,97,Emmy,"Yeah, but that's not what I'm worried about. I'm worried it might hurt my bean sprouts!",,,,
75,99,Player,,,It might.,,
75,100,Emmy,"Yeah, it looks like it prefers technology to nature.",,,,
75,101,Player,,,Let's say it does.,,
75,102,Emmy,"Well, most tech I'm familiar with tends to break when its circuits are exposed to water. If you get that thing on the ground and open it up I can dump my watering can on it.",,,,
75,103,Player,,,I'd appreciate that.,,
75,104,Emmy,"I'm all for helping you get rid of that robot, but until it's on the floor with its wires exposed, keep it away from my plants please!",,,,
75,105,Player,,,Fine.,,
75,106,Emmy,Good job destroying that robot. I wouldn't want it to hurt my bean sprouts.,,,,
75,107,Player,,,It's gonna explode.,,
75,108,Player,,,Heaven forbid.,,
75,109,Emmy,What?!<kgwait> But that will disrupt the whole ecosystem! You have to stop it!,,,,
75,110,Player,,,Pour some water on it.,,
75,111,Emmy,"Oh yeah!<kgwait> That will probably do it! Okay! I'm on it!<kgwait> Don't worry, my babies. I'll be back soon.",,,,
75,112,PlayerCharacter,,,,,
75,113,Emmy,"I hate wasting water like this, but I also hate exploding into a million pieces.",,,,
75,114,Emmy,,,,,
75,115,Emmy,"There. That takes care of-<kgwait> Hey, what's that?",,,,
75,116,Emmy,,,,,
75,117,Emmy,"I think it's fried, but I saw this glowing thing inside of it.<kgwait> It's humming pretty loudly. I don't know what it does, but you should probably find a place to put it sooner than later.",,,,
75,118,Player,,,Good idea.,,
75,119,Emmy,Please get that thing away from me. I think it's gonna explode.,,,,
75,120,Player,,,I don't want it either.,,
75,121,Emmy,Then find someone who does!<kgwait> It's not me though! Now go!,,,,
75,122,Player,,,(Go.),,
75,123,Emmy,"Oh, hello...<kgwait> Um...<kgwait> You have a robot floating above you.",,,,
75,124,Emmy,"Oh, good. It's on the ground. It can't hurt my bean sprouts there.",,,,
75,125,Player,,,Wanna pour some water on it?,,
75,126,Emmy,"Why?<kgwait> It looks pretty waterproof.<kgwait> Unless its insides are exposed, I'm not wasting water on that thing.",,,,
75,127,Player,,,I see.,,
75,128,Emmy,What the heck?! Where's the teacher?!<kgwait> That awful girl just stole my watering can!<kgwait>*sniff*<kgwait> I guess I'll just have to water my bean sprouts with my tears.,,,,
75,129,Emmy,,,She ran out of here crying.,,
75,130,Player,,,Will do.,,
76,0,Player,,,,,
76,1,Emmy,,,,,
76,2,Emmy,I told you already!<kgwait> You can only have the red flowers! The blue ones are deadly-,,,,
76,3,Cindy,"And I'm telling you, Dandelion Debbie, I'm taking whichever flowers I want. ",,,,
76,4,Cindy,"Hey, kid!<kgwait> Tell the Cauliflower Karen here that I can take whatever flowers I want!",,,,
76,5,Emmy,No! I'm warning you! The blue ones are gonna make you sick!,,,,
76,6,Player,,,She can have what she wants.,,
76,8,Player,,,I'm not gonna get involved.,,
76,9,Emmy,But- but- no she'll get-,,,,
76,10,Cindy,"Ha! I'll be taking those blue flowers then!<kgwait> Later, Rutabaga Rhonda!",,,,
76,11,Emmy,She's gonna live to regret that. I hope you're happy.,,,,
76,12,Player,,,We'll see.,,
76,14,Cindy,,,,,
76,25,Emmy,You already took the red flowers! You can't have any more! Besides the blue ones are deadly-,,,,
76,26,Cindy,"Hey, kid!<kgwait> I'm not being in any more plays until you tell Cauliflower Karen here that I can take whatever flowers I want!",,,,
76,27,Emmy,"I told you that wasn't a good idea, but I guess that's one less weed in my garden.",,,,
76,28,Player,,,I guess it is.,,
76,29,Emmy,,,,,
76,30,Emmy,,,,,
76,31,Emmy,But- but- no! NO!<kgwait> You can't! You took my blue flowers this morning! You still have them!,,,,
76,32,Cindy,What?<kgwait> These?<kgwait> I dunno.<kgwait> I'm kinda feeling red now. In fact...,,,,
76,33,Cindy,,,,,
76,34,Emmy,*Sigh*...<kgwait> She's gotta go.,,,,
76,35,Player,,,Go?,,
76,36,Emmy,"Yeah.<kgwait> I tried to be nice.<kgwait> For the good of my plants,<kgwait> that girl is gonna be fertilizer.",,,,
76,37,Player,,,How do we do that?,,
76,38,Emmy,I'm gonna need a shovel and some plants that have been infected with goo.,,,,
76,39,Player,,,Ummm... why?,,
76,40,Player,,,I'm not gonna ask questions.,,
76,41,Emmy,I'm gonna fight that monster with some of my own.,,,,
76,42,Player,,,I see.,,
76,43,Emmy,"If I can plant and nurture some of the goo plants in my dead garden, I should be able to make something... <kgwait>carnivorous.",,,,
76,44,Emmy,,,Good. Just make sure I get all of that before the bell rings.,,
76,45,Player,,,Can do.,,
76,48,Player,,,So where are they?,,
76,49,Emmy,There are definitely some in Mr. Scippio's classroom. If the teacher is distracted you could definitely run inside and grab them for me.,,,,
76,50,Player,,,"Oh, okay.",,
76,51,Emmy,Here's my last carrot. You might need it to deal with Bunny.,,,,
76,52,Player,,,Thanks.,,
76,53,Player,,,Bunny?,,
76,54,Emmy,He's one of the rabbits that lives in the tree. I don't think he'll let you take the shovel unless he's distracted with something else.,,,,
76,55,Player,,,Got it.,,
76,56,Emmy,Did you find all the stuff yet?,,,,
76,57,Player,,,Where's the shovel?,,
76,58,Player,,,Where are the goo plants?,,
76,59,Player,,,Still working on that.,,
76,60,Emmy,It looks like someone left it over by the tree. Just watch out for Bunny.,,,,
76,61,Emmy,I know for sure there are some in Mr. Scippio's class. I wouldn't go for the beanstalk. It seemed pretty strong.,,,,
76,66,Player,,,Got it.,,
76,67,Player,,,I did!,,
76,68,Emmy,Oh my gosh! You did it!<kgwait> Thank you!<kgwait> I'm gonna go plant these!<kgwait> Let's see how that little thistle likes it when the plants fight back!,,,,
76,69,Player,,,Can't wait.,,
76,70,Emmy,She's lucky she didn't die. Maybe next time.,,,,
76,71,Player,,,Yeah... maybe.,,
76,72,Emmy,I've never seen so many kids get so heated over flowers before.<kgwait> Maybe we'll get along afterall.,,,,
76,73,Player,,,Maybe.,,
76,74,Emmy,*Sigh* My tummy hurts.,,,,
76,75,Player,,,Are you okay?,,
76,76,Emmy,She took everything. My food. My flowers. She just came by and took the last red flowers I had. She's a real blight.,,,,
76,77,Player,,,Yeah.,,
76,78,Emmy,I'm just gonna sit here next to the corpse of my garden. Maybe my tears will bring it back to life.,,,,
76,79,Player,,,I doubt it.,,
76,80,Emmy,Just let me cry here. I don't want to talk to anyone else today.,,,,
76,81,Player,,,(Let her cry.),,
76,82,Emmy,I just love watching things grow.,,,,
76,83,Player,,,That's nice.,,
77,0,Player,,,,,
77,1,Austin,,,,,
77,2,Austin,Hehehe...<kgwait> I love smashing stuff.,,,,
77,3,Player,,,You're gonna smash stuff?,,
77,4,Player,,,(Don't get involved.),,
77,5,Austin,You bet I am!<kgwait> HYAH!,,,,
77,6,Austin,,,,,
77,7,Austin,Woohoo!<kgwait> Breaking stuff is so cool!,,,,
77,8,Player,,,It really is.,,
77,9,Austin,"So we're good here, right Ms. L?",,,,
77,10,Teacher,"<wave>I'm sorry but no, I take this quite serious.<kgwait><br>No more playing house, or I'll be quite furious.</wave>",,,,
77,11,Austin,Aw man.,,,,
77,12,Teacher,,,,,
77,13,Austin,,,,,
77,14,Austin,Aw man. I really wanted to play house with Alice today.,,,,
77,15,Player,,,"That's rough, buddy.",,
77,16,Austin,I hope Davey doesn't make us do anything weird for him. Now let's get these kids back to the girls.,,,,
77,17,Player,,,Good idea.,,
77,18,Austin,"Doing homework isn't exactly my idea of a good time, but hanging out with Alice is, so I'm okay with it.",,,,
77,19,Player,,,"That's nice, Austin.",,
77,20,Player,,,You're gonna smash stuff?,,
77,21,Austin,I mean... <kgwait>I would if we were doing the Little Red Riding Hood play. The teacher only takes the chains off the axe when we do that one.,,,,
77,22,Player,,,Oh.,,
77,23,Austin,"Woah, kid!<kgwait> Don't go bringing that thing over here!<kgwait> It's scaring Alice!",,,,
77,24,Player,,,Can you help me get rid of it?,,
77,25,Player,,,My bad.,,
77,26,Alice,"Yes!<kgwait> He can!<kgwait> Austin, please!<kgwait> Do something!",,,,
77,27,Austin,Uh-<kgwait> Will a rock do?,,,,
77,28,Player,,,It usually does.,,
77,29,Austin,Yeah! Rocks are good for everything! HYAH!,,,,
77,30,PlayerCharacter,,,,,
77,31,Austin,,,,,
77,32,Austin,Look man... I did my part. Alice is safe. That's all I care about.,,,,
77,33,Player,,,Such a gentleman.,,
77,34,Austin,I can't believe she finally asked me to play house with her!<kgwait> Just gotta not screw this up!,,,,
77,35,Player,,,"You'll do great, Austin.",,
78,0,Player,,,,,
78,1,Austin,,,,,
78,2,Austin,Hehehe... Old man won't know what hit him.,,,,
78,3,Player,,,What are you about to do?,,
78,4,Player,,,I'm not getting involved.,,
78,5,Austin,I'm gonna see if I can hit the back of the janitor's shiny head with this burger! It's gonna be sick!,,,,
78,6,Player,,,It'll be something.,,
78,7,Austin,I think I'm gonna do it! Do you think Alice is watching?,,,,
78,8,Player,,,I'm sure she is.,,
78,9,Player,,,She's not.,,
78,10,Austin,"Good! Okay, here goes!",,,,
78,11,Austin,,,,,
78,12,Austin,Oh. I guess I'll wait then.,,,,
78,13,Player,,,Good call.,,
78,19,Austin,Hehehe... Looks like it's time for plan B.,,,,
78,20,Player,,,Plan B?,,
78,21,Austin,"Yeah!<kgwait> I was gonna chuck this burger at the janitor but he left, so I'm gonna hit the new lunch lady instead.",,,,
78,22,Player,,,Brilliant!,,
78,23,Player,,,Good luck with that.,,
78,24,Austin,I know!<kgwait> Here goes!,,,,
78,25,Austin,,,,,
78,26,Austin,"Another day, another thing I've thrown. It's good to be me... <kgwait>even if I do have study hall.",,,,
78,27,Player,,,As long as you're happy.,,
78,28,Austin,Man... this kinda sucks.,,,,
78,29,Player,,,What sucks?,,
78,30,Austin,"Well... <kgwait>normally I would throw something at the lunch lady or the janitor, but it doesn't look like either of them are here today.",,,,
78,31,Player,,,Bummer.,,
78,32,Player,,,I'm not interested in what sucks.,,
78,33,Austin,Ummm... <kgwait>hey.,,,,
78,34,Applegate_Lunch,Hello! What would you like for lunch?,,,,
78,35,Austin,Uhhh... <kgwait>I'll take a uuuuuuuhhhhh...,,,,

78,51,Austin,Ummm... <kgwait>weren't you supposed to go with Alice?,,,,
78,52,Player,,,Oh yeah.,,
78,53,Austin,Looks like she couldn't get in to see Scippio. You shoulda helped her out.,,,,
78,54,Player,,,Oh yeah.,,
78,55,Austin,So Scippio was a bit of a dud. What's the next step then?,,,,
78,56,Austin,,,,,
78,57,Austin,Woah. I can't believe I was about to throw this burger at that guy.<kgwait> That could have been me getting hit with that mop.,,,,
78,58,Player,,,Yes it could have.,,
78,59,Player,,,She's not even here.,,
78,60,Austin,Oh. Bummer.<kgwait> Do you wanna watch me throw it then?,,,,
78,61,Player,,,Sure.,,
78,62,Player,,,No thanks.,,
78,63,Austin,Just make sure you cut the power like we talked about.<kgwait> I don't want anything bad to happen to Alice.,,,,
78,64,Player,,,Me neither.,,
78,65,Austin,Man...<kgwait> This is like the sixth time this week I've gotten study hall.,,,,
78,66,Player,,,It's only Wednesday.,,
78,67,Austin,Oh...<kgwait> Maybe I should spend my time in study hall learning how to count.,,,,
78,68,Player,,,Good idea.,,
79,0,Player,,,,,
79,1,Austin,,,,,
79,2,Austin,Stupid Davey.<kgwait> King of the Playground... <kgwait>what a joke.,,,,
79,3,Player,,,(Let him brood.),,
79,4,Austin,I think I can totally hit it.,,,,
79,5,Player,,,Hit what?,,
79,6,Player,,,I'm not interested.,,
79,7,Austin,"That window!<kgwait> It's a long shot, but I've been working out! I'm just a little worried about hitting Birdy.",,,,
79,8,Player,,,Birdy?,,
79,9,Austin,Oh yeah!<kgwait> You're new here. Birdy is that scary bird on the swings.<kgwait> He can be a little temperamental.,,,,
79,10,Player,,,You can totally make that shot.,,
79,11,Austin,You think?<kgwait> Yeah! I'm pretty talented at rock throwing! Here goes!,,,,
79,12,Austin,<size=100>HYAH!!</size>,,,,
79,13,Austin,,,,,
79,14,Player,,,I wouldn't try it.,,
79,15,Austin,Yeah you're right.<kgwait> I'm gonna wait here. Maybe he'll leave.,,,,
79,16,Player,,,Maybe.,,
79,17,Austin,Hmmm... <kgwait>Maybe I can make the shot. Birdy isn't that hard to avoid.,,,,
79,18,Austin,I'm sorry Birdy!<kgwait> It was an accident! <kgwait>I didn't mean to-,,,,
79,19,Austin,"Well, shoot...<kgwait> We are really high up here Birdy.",,,,
79,20,Austin,Uh oh.,,,,
79,21,Austin,,,,,
79,22,Austin,<size=100>AAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!</size>,,,,
79,23,Austin,,,,,

79,25,Austin,"That window!<kgwait> It's a long shot, but now that the bird is gone, I'm pretty sure I can make it!",,,,
79,26,Player,,,I wouldn't try it.,,
79,27,Austin,Oh. Yeah. I guess. Standing here is cool too.,,,,
79,28,Player,,,It sure is.,,

79,40,Austin,About time you got here!<kgwait> We gotta hurry if we're gonna save Alice!,,,,
79,41,Player,,,Where is she?,,
79,42,Austin,"She went into the tree! It looks like Regis's awful dog thing can't reach her there, but I don't know how long that will last!",,,,
79,43,Player,,,What do we do?,,
79,44,Austin,"Well, I was gonna throw a rock at it, but if you have a better idea, I'm all ears.",,,,
79,45,Player,,,I'll see what I can do.,,
79,46,Austin,"Okay, but hurry up. I'm not gonna let that thing eat her!",,,,
79,47,Player,,,Okay okay.,,
79,48,Austin,Ummm... <kgwait>where's Alice?,,,,
79,49,Player,At the bottom of a pit.,,,,
79,50,Player,,,Eaten by a monster.,,
79,51,Player,,,I dunno.,,

79,72,Davey,Hey! Peasants!<kgwait> Are you ready to be my loyal knights?,,,,
79,73,Austin,Dude!<kgwait> We got waaaaay bigger problems! There's a monster going after Alice!,,,,
79,74,Davey,"There's a fair maiden in distress?!<kgwait> Wow. You guys are really into being my knights, huh?",,,,
79,75,Austin,"Yeah.<kgwait> Sure.<kgwait> Whatever, your majesty. Just help us with the stupid monster.",,,,
79,76,Davey,Very well. You have the resources of the castle at your disposal.<kgwait> Bring me the beast's head and rescue the maiden! I await your return!,,,,

79,83,Davey,"If you stupid knights are done getting beat up by a bunny, could you please deal with this monster at my gates!?",,,,
79,84,Austin,Oh yeah. I guess we should do that so Alice will be safe.,,,,

81,12,Player,,,What's wrong?,,
81,13,Carla,The only exit to this vent system is the way I got in and there's someone currently... <kgwait>taking care of business if you catch my drift.,,,,
81,14,Player,,,So what do I do?,,
81,15,Carla,You're gonna use my screwdriver to open this thing.<kgwait> We need a way to get you up here to let me out.,,,,
81,16,Player,,,That's pretty high.,,
81,17,Carla,"Yeah, but I hear the teacher likes to put on plays!<kgwait> Maybe she has a ladder or a prop that we could set up?",,,,
81,18,Player,,,Got it.,,
81,19,Carla,And if you could put a rush on that...<kgwait> It's starting to smell.,,,,
81,20,Player,,,(Rush it.),,
81,21,Carla,"Good work, kid!<kgwait> This shortcut is gonna be very useful in the coming days!",,,,
81,22,Player,,,Happy to help.,,
81,23,Carla,Let's get down from here.,,,,
81,24,Player,,,Good idea.,,
81,25,Carla,Where were you?!,,,,
81,26,Player,,,I was around.,,
81,27,Carla,Not where I needed you!,,,,
81,28,Player,,,Sounds like a 'you' problem.,,
81,29,Carla,Yeah. I guess it is a ME problem.<kgwait> Looks like I have to do everything MYSELF.<kgwait> Leave ME alone.,,,,
81,30,Player,,,Fine. Jeez.,,
81,31,Carla,"Don't bother me anymore, kid. Looks like I can't count on you.",,,,
81,32,Player,,,Looks like.,,
81,33,Carla,Dum de doo. Nice weather today. Nothing crazy going on here. No killer robots. I don't see anything.,,,,
81,34,Player,,,What?,,
81,35,Carla,"Look kid, after all the stuff we dealt with at our last school, I just pretend not see anything robotic and murderous.",,,,
81,36,Player,,,That's fair.,,
81,37,Carla,,,,,
81,38,Carla,"Dang, kid.<kgwait> You made that look easy. Where was that energy with Penny yesterday?",,,,
81,39,Player,,,That's a bit complicated.,,
81,40,Carla,Stevie always ruins my plans.<kgwait> We'll get an earlier start tomorrow.,,,,
81,41,Player,,,Sounds good.,,
81,42,Carla,Navigating this place is gonna be so easy.<kgwait> A whole vent system that's totally open. What more could a girl dream of?,,,,
81,43,Player,,,A pony?,,
81,44,Carla,"Well, yeah.<kgwait> A pony would be great, but I'll take vents as a close second.",,,,
81,45,Player,,,Me too.,,
82,0,Player,,,,,
82,1,Carla,,,,,
82,2,Carla,,,,,
82,3,Carla,"Hey, kid! I was hoping to see you.",,,,
82,4,Player,,,You were?,,
82,20,Carla,,,,,
82,21,Carla,"Hey, kid. I wish you had come by earlier. I had a pretty interesting scheme cooked up, but I guess we'll have to try another time.",,,,
82,22,Player,,,Bummer.,,
82,27,Carla,,,,,
82,31,Player,,,That's nice. Bye.,,
82,50,Carla,I saw the teacher give you a little something after everyone left. It was a library card right?,,,,
82,51,Player,,,Yeah.,,
82,52,Carla,Cool. I'll make you a deal.The library card for a distraction to get out of here. What do you say?,,,,
82,53,Player,,,Deal.,,
82,54,Player,,,No deal.,,
82,55,Carla,Your loss. Let me know if you change your mind.,,,,
82,56,Player,,,Fair enough.,,
82,57,Carla,Awesome! I'm not gonna give it back so make sure you're done with it before you give it to me.,,,,
82,58,Player,,,Here you go.,,
82,59,Player,,,Gimme a minute.,,
82,60,Carla,A deal's a deal. I'll keep Applegate distracted for a little bit. Good luck with whatever you're doing.,,,,
82,61,Player,,,Thanks!,,
82,62,Carla,Perfect timing. You ready to pop some more vents?,,,,
82,63,Player,,,You betcha.,,
82,64,Player,,,Not yet.,,
82,65,Carla,"Good. We got a lot to do so pay attention.<kgwait> There are four more vents to open.<kgwait> There's one in here, the nurse's office, the library, and the janitor's closet.",,,,
82,66,Player,,,How do you know that?,,
82,67,Carla,I spent some time crawling around up there. I think I was able to map the two vent systems correctly.,,,,
82,68,Player,,,Where do we start?,,
82,69,Carla,"I'm gonna distract Applegate for you.<kgwait> While she's not looking, pop open the vent behind her and get out of here before you're seen.",,,,
82,70,Player,,,Then what?,,
82,71,Carla,"In case you haven't noticed, Nugget isn't here. He's probably still in the classroom with his broken legs.",,,,
82,72,Player,,,Probably.,,
82,73,Carla,"If you tell the nurse he's hurt, she'll have to leave to go help him, which will leave the vent in her office unguarded!",,,,
82,74,Player,,,Oooooh.,,
82,75,Carla,Just pop that vent and we'll worry about the other two during study hall.,,,,
82,76,Player,,,Works for me.,,
82,77,Carla,You ready to do this?,,,,
82,78,Carla,"Okay. Whenever you're ready, I'll keep her busy.",,,,
82,79,Player,,,I'm ready.,,
82,80,Player,,,Not yet.,,
82,81,Carla,Okay. Good luck!,,,,
82,82,Player,,,You too.,,
82,83,Carla,Sorry. Can you tell me the choices again?<kgwait> All this new food makes it so hard to make a decision!,,,,
82,84,Applegate_Lunch,Yeah sure.<kgwait> Not like I have anything better to do.,,,,
82,85,Applegate_Lunch,,,,,
82,86,Player,,,Two systems?,,
82,87,Carla,"Yeah! From what I can tell, there's a system that links the cafeteria, classroom, and bathroom. The other connects the library, nurse's office, and janitor's closet.",,,,
82,88,Carla,Dude! What the heck?!,,,,
82,89,Player,,,"Oh hi, Carla.",,
82,90,Carla,Don't give me that!<kgwait> You left me up there in that smelly vent! What gives?!,,,,
82,91,Player,,,I did my best.,,
82,92,Carla,Your 'best' is laughable. Gimme back my screwdriver.<kgwait> Get lost.,,,,
82,93,Player,,,Fine.,,
82,94,Carla,Oh no you don't.<kgwait> You already left me in a smelly vent all morning.<kgwait> I'm done with you.,,,,
82,95,Player,,,"Whatever, Carla.",,
82,96,Player,,,I need help with Stevie.,,
82,97,Carla,Uh-huh.<kgwait> What's in it for me?,,,,
82,98,Player,,,What do you want?,,
82,99,Carla,I saw the teacher give you a library card after that little show this morning. We can start with that.,,,,
82,100,Player,,,Cool. Deal.,,
82,101,Carla,"Woah, woah, woah. That's not all.",,,,
82,102,Player,,,What else?,,
82,103,Carla,I saw that she also gave you a hall pass. I want that too.,,,,
82,104,Player,,,I don't have it anymore.,,
82,105,Carla,Then you better go find it.<kgwait> The card and the pass for me getting rid of Stevie.,,,,
82,106,Player,,,I'll be back.,,
82,107,Carla,So where are we on that pass?,,,,
82,108,Player,,,Still working on it.,,
82,109,Player,,,Got it.,,
82,110,Carla,Excellent.<kgwait> A deal's a deal.,,,,
82,111,Player,,,Great.,,
82,112,Carla,"Hey, Stevie!<kgwait> You know the drill.",,,,
82,113,Stevie,"Please not today, Carla.",,,,
82,114,Carla,"Yeah, unfortunately for you, it's definitley today.",,,,
82,115,Stevie,I'm not moving! I'm also not chasing you!<kgwait> I just have to block this do-,,,,
82,116,Carla,,,,,
82,117,Stevie,<size=100>AAAAAHHHH!!!</size>,,,,
82,118,Stevie,Bring that back!<kgwait> I need it to monitor the halls!,,,,
82,120,Carla,There.<kgwait> I don't think he will-<kgwait> I don't think he CAN bother you anymore.,,,,
82,121,Player,,,Uh thanks.,,
82,122,Carla,"Yeah, I don't feel super great about that.<kgwait> Here's his crutch in case you wanted to do something with that.",,,,
82,123,Player,,,Maybe I will.,,
82,124,Carla,Pleasure doing business with you.,,,,
82,125,Player,,,It always is Carla.,,
82,126,Player,,,Not much.,,
82,127,Player,,,No way.,,
82,128,Carla,Okay. Good luck finding another way around him.,,,,
82,129,Player,,,Thanks.,,
82,130,Carla,C'mon Stevie!<kgwait> No one is even here! Let me through!,,,,
82,131,Stevie,No!<kgwait> I don't care if they dismissed school early! I'm still on the clock and I was told to monitor this door so that's what I'm gonna do!,,,,
82,132,Carla,You're ridiculous.,,,,
82,133,Stevie,And you're needlessly difficult! Now back it up!,,,,
82,134,Carla,I'm not moving until you do.,,,,
82,135,Stevie,Fine! Be that way! We'll just stand here all day then!,,,,
82,136,Carla,,,,,
82,137,Monty,"Why'd you have to go and do that, Carla?!<kgwait> We were supposed to have support group for our janitor trauma! Not our hostile classmate trauma!",,,,
82,138,Carla,"What's up, kid?",,,,
82,139,Carla,Oh! You're back!<kgwait> I was expecting that to take longer. Did you get both vents open?,,,,
82,140,Player,,,I did not.,,
82,141,Carla,I see... <kgwait>so what do you think happens now?,,,,
82,142,Player,,,I go have lunch?,,
82,143,Carla,Yeah. I guess so. Gimme back my screwdriver. We're through.,,,,
82,144,Player,,,Aw man.,,
82,145,Carla,"Can't trust anyone around here. Want something done, gotta do it myself.",,,,
82,146,Player,,,(Let her grumble to herself.),,
82,147,Carla,Dude!<kgwait> What was that?!,,,,
82,148,Player,,,What was what?,,
82,149,Carla,You didn't even try to sneak out!,,,,
82,150,Player,,,"Oh, that.",,
82,151,Carla,Yeah.<kgwait> That.<kgwait> Gimme my screwdriver. We're done.,,,,
82,152,Carla,I hope you got your stuff taken care of. I'm not talking to that ridiculous woman again.,,,,
82,153,Player,,,I wouldn't either.,,
83,0,Player,,,,,
83,1,Carla,,,,,
83,2,Carla,"Jeez, I must be losing my touch.<kgwait> Can't believe I got caught.",,,,
83,3,Player,,,What are you in for?,,
83,4,Player,,,(Ignore her.),,
83,5,Carla,I got caught trying to break into one of those air vents. Stupid Regis caught me.,,,,
83,6,Player,,,Brutal.,,
83,11,Player,,,Seems easy enough.,,
83,12,Carla,"Once you're out, you need to find someone named Mr. Scippio. I heard a rumor that he was supposed to take over as janitor before we moved here today.",,,,
83,13,Player,,,Got it.,,
83,14,Carla,I'll cover for you while you're gone. Get going!,,,,
83,15,Player,,,(Get going.),,
83,16,Carla,Why are you still here? Clock is ticking!,,,,
83,17,Player,,,Stevie and Monty are having group therapy.,,
83,18,Carla,What?!<kgwait> Oy!<kgwait> Nerds!,,,,
83,19,Stevie,"Not now, Carla! Monty has the Talking Teddy.",,,,
83,20,Monty,Yeah!<kgwait> Now where was I?<kgwait> Oh yeah... <kgwait>and then he hit me with his mop.,,,,
83,21,Stevie,I hear and accept you. The mop doesn't change who you are on the inside... <kgwait>but it does radically change who you are on the outside.,,,,
83,22,Carla,"Okay, that's enough!<kgwait> Now it's my turn to talk!<kgwait> Gimme that bear!",,,,
83,23,Carla,,,,,
83,24,Monty,"Carla, no! I was about to have a breakthrough! Bring that back!",,,,
83,25,Stevie,You don't understand! Mop beatings can happen to anyone! It's a major problem!,,,,
83,26,Stevie,,,,,
83,27,Player,,,Oh yeah.,,
83,28,Monty,"Give it back, Carla!",,,,
83,29,Carla,You'll have to take it from me!,,,,
83,30,Monty,My arms don't work!,,,,
83,31,Player,,,(Let them sort this out.),,
83,32,Carla,Fine!<kgwait> Take the stupid bear.<kgwait> I hope you both get impaled by that stupid mop you keep whining about.,,,,
83,33,Stevie,Let's not say things we can't take back. Mop trauma is the leading cause of-,,,,
83,34,Carla,"Shut it, Stevie. I liked you better when you were just an annoying hall monitor.",,,,
83,35,Stevie,"Okay.<kgwait> We're gonna get back to group now. <kgwait>C'mon, Monty.",,,,
83,36,Monty,Could you pick up the bear for me? My arms...,,,,
83,37,Stevie,"Sure, buddy.",,,,
83,38,Stevie,,,,,
83,39,Carla,Why are you still here?,,,,
83,40,Player,,,Should I not be?,,
83,41,Carla,Duh!<kgwait> You should have left while I had them distracted! Were you waiting for a handwritten invitation!?,,,,
83,42,Player,,,An invitation would have been nice.,,
83,43,Carla,*Sigh*<kgwait> Nevermind. Gimme back my screwdriver.<kgwait> We're done here.,,,,
83,44,Player,,,Aw man.,,
83,45,Carla,Good work on that cafeteria vent. Please tell me you got to the one in the nurse's office.,,,,
83,46,Player,,,Easy peasy.,,
83,47,Player,,,About that...,,
83,48,Carla,Well I'll be danged!<kgwait> You're as sneaky as I am!,,,,
83,49,Player,,,Aw shucks.,,
83,50,Carla,"Yeah, yeah. Don't let it go to your head.<kgwait> The next vent is right over there.",,,,
83,51,Player,,,Where can I find him?,,
83,52,Carla,"Apparently, he was a teacher here, but had some sort of nervous breakdown. I would check his classroom.",,,,
83,53,Carla,*sigh*<kgwait> Figures. Nevermind. We had a good run.,,,,
83,54,Player,,,We can still try.,,
83,55,Carla,"Yeah except there's only two ways out of this room. The vent and the door and since you can't leave through the vent, we're kinda screwed.",,,,
83,56,Player,,,Oh.,,
83,57,Carla,Yeah. Gimme back my screwdriver. We're done here.,,,,
83,58,Player,,,Aw man.,,
83,59,Player,,,Why him?,,
83,60,Carla,He was supposed to take over as janitor before we got transferred here.<kgwait> I'm willing to bet he has a key to the closet!,,,,
83,61,Carla,Well you're back early. <kgwait>Did you actually manage to open the vent in the janitor's closet?,,,,
83,62,Player,,,Nope.,,
83,63,Carla,"Yeah, I figured. Gimme back my screwdriver. We're done here.",,,,
83,64,Player,,,Aw man.,,
83,65,Carla,Can't believe you came back early. Rookie move. Leave me alone.,,,,
83,66,Player,,,(Leave her alone.),,
83,67,Carla,I got caught crawling around on of those air vents. Stupid Regis caught me.,,,,
83,68,Carla,Did you not hear me? We're done. Adios. Get lost.,,,,
83,69,Player,,,(Get lost.),,
83,70,Carla,So...<kgwait>I think you forgot something.,,,,
83,71,Player,,,What?,,
83,72,Carla,You didn't open the cafeteria vent.<kgwait> You just kinda walked out.,,,,
83,73,Player,,,Oh.,,
84,0,Player,,,,,
84,1,Lily,,,,,
84,2,Lily,But you don't understand!<kgwait> Kids are being captured and experimented on!<kgwait> We have to-,,,,
84,3,Teacher,<wave>I don't have to do anything! I'm filled with dismay!<kgwait><br>Now go to study hall for skipping class all day!</wave>,,,,
84,4,Lily,I wasn't skipping for fun! I was-<kgwait> Did that just rhyme?<kgwait> Nevermind. Just please let me-,,,,
84,5,Teacher,"<wave>I won't let you do anything! Get inside now!<kgwait><br>If you don't listen, I'm gonna have a cow!</wave>",,,,
84,6,Lily,*Ugh!*<kgwait> Fine!,,,,
84,7,Lily,"Hi, Nugget. *Ahem*<kgwait> You can do this, Alice!<kgwait> Go save Kevin!",,,,
84,8,Teacher,,,,,
84,9,Nugget,"Hello, pretty Lily.",,,,
84,12,Lily,Good work!<kgwait> You guys get to class so you don't get in trouble.<kgwait> See if you can get out and meet me in Scippio's classroom.,,,,
84,13,Nugget,Nugget eagerly awaits his reunion with the pretty Lily.,,,,
84,14,Lily,Right...<kgwait> Everyone knows the plan-,,,,
84,15,Player,,,See ya.,,
84,16,Nugget,Birdy says we have mere moments before he removes our intestines in a Promethean fashion.,,,,
84,17,Lily,Then let's get the heck out of here!<kgwait> I'll see you guys in a little while.,,,,
84,18,Lily,,,,,
84,19,Lily,Get that shovel for Nugget. We only have until the bell rings for him to dig this hole!,,,,
84,20,Player,,,I got it.,,
84,21,Lily,Good. Go give it to him so he can start working.,,,,
84,22,Player,,,Oh yeah.,,
84,23,Player,,,Right. Right.,,
84,24,Lily,Give that shovel to Nugget so he can get working.,,,,
84,25,Player,,,I did.,,
84,26,Lily,"So now we need the nuggets.<kgwait> He said something about the bird taking you to them, whatever that means.",,,,
84,27,Player,,,Oh yeah.,,
84,28,Player,,,Hmmm...,,
84,29,Lily,Nugget said something about the bird knowing about the nuggets.,,,,
84,30,Lily,"We'll meet you down there, kid!",,,,
84,31,PlayerCharacter,,,,,
84,32,Player,,,He says there isn't enough time.,,
84,33,Lily,Wait... <kgwait>what took you so long to get the shovel?,,,,
84,34,Player,,,Stuff.,,
84,35,Lily,Darn it kid!<kgwait> We were already cutting it close! If Nugget can't dig that cave before the bell rings we can't save Kevin!,,,,
84,36,Player,,,What now?,,
84,37,Lily,Now... <kgwait>we try again tomorrow. We'll do it better.<kgwait> We'll do it right.,,,,
84,38,Player,,,Fair enough.,,
84,39,Lily,I guess I'll just wait here until after the bell rings. I don't trust anyone who rhymes with such enthusiasm.,,,,
84,40,Player,,,Good call.,,
84,41,Lily,Is everyone okay out here?<kgwait> I heard a lot of stuff. I thought for sure someone would be dog food by now.,,,,
84,42,Nugget,"It has been handled, pretty Lily. Nugget and Nugget's goo-curing friend have saved the poor doggy, birdy, guppy, and bunnies.",,,,
84,43,Lily,Wow.<kgwait> That's great!<kgwait> Do you know anything about Kevin?,,,,
84,44,Nugget,Nugget hears Kevin beneath the school. The friendly alligator will take us to him.,,,,
84,45,Lily,Ummm... <kgwait>okay. Whatever that means.,,,,
84,46,Nugget,Everybody follow Nugget to the friendly alligator!,,,,
84,47,Player,,,(Follow Nugget.),,
86,0,Player,,,,,
86,1,Monty,,,,,
86,2,Monty,Stupid morning time. Can't run my business without my arms.,,,,
86,3,Player,,,Got any cigarettes?,,
86,4,Monty,"Normally I would, but I sold them all to the hall monitor yesterday.",,,,
86,5,Player,,,Darn it.,,
86,6,Player,,,(Let him brood.),,
86,7,Player,,,Can you tutor math?,,
86,8,Monty,Of course I can. I'm smarter than all you other kids combined.,,,,
86,9,Player,,,Cool. Thanks.,,
86,10,Monty,"C'mon, kid. You know me better than that by now. It's gonna cost ya.",,,,
86,11,Player,,,How much?,,
86,12,Monty,It'll cost you one... <kgwait>pill.,,,,
86,13,Player,,,A pill?,,
86,14,Monty,"Yeah! You get me a pill, I'll teach you math.",,,,
86,15,Player,,,I'll see what I can do.,,
86,16,Player,,,Here ya go.,,
86,17,Monty,Pleasure doing business with ya. So who am I tutoring?,,,,
86,19,Monty,Got that pill yet?,,,,
86,20,Player,,,Not yet.,,
86,21,Player,,,Cindy's daughter.,,
86,22,Player,,,A doll.,,
86,23,Monty,"Well, here's hoping that apple fell really really really far from that tree.",,,,
86,24,Player,,,I don't think it did.,,
86,25,Monty,Dolls can't do math.,,,,
86,26,Player,,,Neither can Cindy.,,
86,27,Monty,Ya know what?<kgwait> Here. Take this.,,,,
86,28,Player,,,What is it?,,
86,34,Monty,Are you as dumb as Cindy?<kgwait> It's a calculator! It'll do the math for you.,,,,
86,35,Player,,,A calculator?,,
86,36,Monty,Yeah! It'll do the math for you. I think it'll be a much better solution than me having an aneurysm trying to teach Cindy math.,,,,
86,37,Player,,,Good point.,,
86,38,Player,,,That's a good idea.,,
86,39,Monty,Yeah! I think it'll be a much better solution than me having an aneurysm trying to teach you dummies math.,,,,
86,40,Monty,Have fun teaching Cindy math. Braver and smarter people than you have tried.,,,,
86,41,Player,,,I appreaciate that.,,
86,42,Monty,"She knows something. I'm telling you, something is up with her.",,,,
86,43,Player,,,There probably is.,,
86,44,Monty,"Oh no you don't. You're not dragging me into this. I'm happy to loot the parts when you're done, but I'm not getting involved with you and the ball of death.",,,,
86,45,Player,,,Makes sense.,,
86,46,Monty,I can't wait to get my hands on all those juicy robot parts!<kgwait> Maybe I can even get my arms working!,,,,
86,47,Player,,,Can you take this?,,
86,48,Monty,Can I?!<kgwait> Do you know what this is?!<kgwait> Heck yeah I'll take it!<kgwait> Slap it into the little slot on my back!,,,,
86,49,Player,,,(Slappy slappy.),,
86,50,Monty,"C'mon, arms! Move!<kgwait> MOVE!",,,,
86,51,PlayerCharacter,,,,,
86,52,Monty,I can't believe it!<kgwait> I haven't been this happy since-,,,,
86,53,Player,,,You closed that deal in Bangkok?,,
86,54,Monty,Yeah!<kgwait> Wait... <kgwait>how'd you know about that?,,,,
86,55,Player,,,Lucky guess.,,
86,56,Monty,"Well anyway, I normally don't do freebies, but I think this calls for a special favor. You can have one of these bad boys.",,,,
86,57,Player,,,A pill?,,
86,58,Monty,"Yeah! It's my special recipe from yesterday. Applegate loves 'em. Now if you'll excuse me, I got a robot to loot!",,,,
86,59,Player,,,Have fun with that.,,
86,60,Monty,,,,,
86,61,Monty,Good. It's down.<kgwait> Come and get me when it's out.,,,,
86,62,Player,,,Fine.,,
86,63,Player,,,I'm happy for you.,,
86,64,Monty,Hey!<kgwait> There's a little control thing in here. I think I can just push this button and...,,,,
86,65,Monty,,,,,
86,66,Monty,"Yes!<kgwait> Oh, this is so cool!<kgwait> I can spend all day doing this!",,,,
86,67,Monty,,,,,
86,68,Regis,"Attention, students!<kgwait> Attention, students!<kgwait> Due to unforeseen circumstances, school will be dismissing early today! Please proceed outside.",,,,
86,69,Austin,School is out early?!<kgwait> Woohoo!<kgwait> This must be our reward for killing that robot!,,,,
86,70,Alice,I don't think so.<kgwait> Something has gone wrong and he's trying to cover it up and needs all of us out of here.,,,,
86,71,Felix,"Well, I'm not spending another minute in this ugly place. I was planning an escape and this is it!<kgwait> Farewell.",,,,
86,72,Carla,"Good thing I didn't waste any time establishing shortcuts. I have a feeling we're not coming back here tomorrow.<kgwait> I'm out of here, amigos.",,,,
86,73,Emmy,I suppose I can spend more time in the vegetable patch.,,,,
86,74,Cindy,"Yeah, I think rich boy has a point. Maybe he'll let me ride in his limo.",,,,
86,75,Alice,I remember something about that robot. I've seen it before. Regis has something to do with it. I'm gonna check the principal's office.,,,,
86,76,Austin,"Wait for me, Alice!<kgwait> I'll come with you!",,,,
86,77,Alice,,,,,
86,78,Monty,There's so much cool stuff in here!<kgwait> Penny's got nothing on this thing!,,,,
86,79,Player,,,That's a little morbid.,,
86,80,Monty,Our teacher's headless corpse is rotting in the corner over there and no one has said a word. Forgive me for not shedding a tear for the laser girl whose dress I'm wearing.,,,,
86,81,Player,,,Point taken.,,
86,82,Player,,,(Let him loot the robot.),,
86,83,Monty,"It's nice to have my arms AND legs working again.<kgwait> I appreciate it, kid.",,,,
86,84,Player,,,You're welcome.,,
87,0,Player,,,,,
87,1,Monty,,,,,
87,2,Monty,"Hey! Back up, kid! It's my turn to climb up the fort and go down the slide.",,,,
87,3,Player,,,Then go.,,
87,4,Monty,I'm trying! It's hard to climb a ladder with my arms like this!,,,,
87,5,Player,,,Then move.,,
87,6,Monty,Fine... <kgwait>if you pay me.,,,,
87,7,Player,,,Seriously?,,
87,8,Monty,Times are hard when you can't move your arms. Get me some cash and I'll move.,,,,
87,9,Player,,,I'll push you.,,
87,10,Player,,,Fine.,,
87,11,Monty,Hehehe!<kgwait> Good luck!<kgwait> My arms might not work but my legs have been bionically enhanced. I'm not going anywhere.,,,,
87,12,Player,,,Where can I get some cash?,,
87,13,Monty,I'd say check out ole moneybags over there.<kgwait> Kid's got a trust fund. I'm sure he's got a buck he's willing to loan you.,,,,
87,14,Monty,Well? You got my money?,,,,
87,15,Player,,,Here. Now move.,,
87,16,Player,,,Not yet.,,
87,17,Monty,Pleasure doing business with ya.,,,,
87,18,Player,,,Pleasure' is a strong word for it.,,
87,19,Monty,"Even with no arms, I'm still able to turn a profit for the day just by standing somewhere.<kgwait> Man I'm good.",,,,
87,20,Player,,,So good.,,
87,21,Player,,,How about this instead?,,
87,22,Monty,"If it was yesterday, I'd say yes, but I'm walking fine now. It's my arms that don't work.",,,,
87,23,Player,,,What about Stevie?,,
87,24,Monty,"I mean... <kgwait>we were supposed to hold our support group in the library, but since you helped the little axe murderer over there, there's no one to watch over study hall.",,,,
87,25,Player,,,(Push him anyway.),,
87,26,Monty,Oh?!<kgwait> So that's how it's gonna be!<kgwait> DIVERT ALL POWER TO LEGS!!,,,,
87,27,Player,,,What are you talking about?,,
88,0,Player,,,,,
88,1,Alice,,,,,
88,2,Alice,,,,,
88,3,Alice,"Ow! Ow! Ow!<kgwait> Oh, that hurts!<kgwait> Am I bleeding?",,,,
88,4,Cindy,"If whatever that green stuff coming out of you is what you call blood, then yeah.",,,,
88,5,Alice,I think I should go... <kgwait><size=30>down... <kgwait>slide.</size>,,,,
88,6,Cindy,"Yeah, no kidding.<kgwait> Can't believe it took a watering can to the face for you to figure that out.",,,,
88,7,Alice,,,,,
88,8,Alice,Hey!<kgwait> What are you doing here?!<kgwait> Can't you see I'm trying to play house?!,,,,
88,9,Cindy,Spare me.<kgwait> The only one around here who plays house is me and whoever is lucky enough to be my boyfriend!,,,,
88,10,Austin,"Well actually, it looks like this dollhouse fits two families!<kgwait> I think we can all play together... <kgwait>if you can find a husband.",,,,
88,23,Alice,I hope they get home soon! I miss my boys!,,,,
88,24,Player,,,Is this helping you remember?,,
88,25,Player,,,I'm sure you do.,,
88,26,Alice,It is!<kgwait> I feel like something is supposed to happen soon. Let's keep playing!,,,,
88,27,Player,,,Okay.,,
88,28,Alice,"Oh, goodie!<kgwait> My son is home!<kgwait> Now we can help him with his homework!",,,,
88,29,Cindy,No problem!<kgwait> The boys all flock to me anyway.,,,,
88,30,Alice,Doubt it.,,,,
88,31,Cindy,"Shut up!<kgwait> If I don't get a man, no one will be playing house! You can count on that!",,,,
88,32,Alice,,,,,
88,33,Cindy,Homework?!<kgwait> What kinda loser plays house so they can do homework?!,,,,
88,34,Alice,"Our son does his homework so he will be successful in life, but don't worry...<kgwait> I'm sure he'll tip your daughter well.",,,,
88,35,Cindy,Oh yeah?! My daughter is gonna beat your son within an inch of his life! Physically and academically!,,,,
88,36,Cindy,What the heck is my deadbeat husband doing?,,,,
88,37,Alice,He probably did what your last dozen boys did and left you for someone who doesn't smell bad and can actually leave the house.,,,,
88,38,Cindy,"Fine! Well, if he can't play house right, then no one gets to play house at all!",,,,
88,39,Alice,,,,,
88,40,Cindy,Honey! We gotta get our stupid daughter up to speed!,,,,
88,41,Player,,,Ummm... okay?,,
88,42,Cindy,She has to ace this stupid math homework! Are you good at math?,,,,
88,43,Player,,,I'm five.,,
88,44,Cindy,"Okay, so...<kgwait> that's about as high as I can count. We're gonna need some help.",,,,
88,45,Player,,,From who?,,
88,46,Cindy,I dunno! Pick a nerd!<kgwait> I'm sure someone here is good with numbers!,,,,
88,47,Player,,,Fine.,,
88,48,Alice,"Great. Now I'll never know what I forgot. Thanks a lot, pigtails.",,,,
88,49,Player,,,She tends to ruin things.,,
88,50,Alice,"There! All done!<kgwait> Thank you for helping out with the homework, Austin! I'm sure our son will get a good grade.",,,,
88,51,Austin,No problem! Let's go have the teacher grade it and see how we did.,,,,
88,52,Cindy,"Yeah, well we just finished ours too! ",,,,
88,53,Cindy,What?! You guys are done already?! We haven't even started!<kgwait> You must have cheated!,,,,
88,54,Alice,We didn't cheat! Your kid is just stupid!,,,,
88,55,Cindy,That's it!<kgwait> You play house all wrong! No one helps the kids with homework! This is stupid! We're done playing!,,,,
88,56,Alice,We're helping our son do his homework right now. You better get started on it soon if you want to finish in time!,,,,
88,57,Player,,,Right.,,
88,58,Alice,I'll bet your stupid daughter got them all wrong.,,,,
88,60,Cindy,I'll bet your son can't hold down a job.,,,,
88,61,Austin,Ladies! Ladies!<kgwait> Let's just have the teacher check the homework. The bell's about to ring.,,,,
88,62,Cindy,Fine.,,,,
88,63,Alice,Fine.,,,,
88,64,Cindy,,,,,
88,65,Alice,"Hey, Ms. Lovelett. Can you grade this homework for us?",,,,
88,66,Teacher,<wave>Huh? What's this? I didn't assign math!<kgwait><br>You were all supposed to read the Grapes of Wrath!,,,,
88,67,Alice,None of us know what that is. Can you just grade these worksheets? I'm trying to prove a point.,,,,
88,68,Teacher,<wave>*sigh* I suppose I don't want to be a jerk.<kgwait><br>Hand over the worksheets and I'll grade your homework.</wave>,,,,
88,69,Teacher,"<wave>Alice, yours isn't bad. Your performance was strong.<kgwait><br> It looks like you only got one question wrong!</wave>",,,,
88,70,Teacher,"<wave>But Austin, I'm impressed you did this at all.<kgwait><br>In fact, I'll be revoking your study hall!</wave>",,,,
88,71,Teacher,<wave>It was all in good fun. You are just a kid!<kgwait><br>Now on to the next paper. Let's see how you did!</wave>,,,,
88,72,Teacher,"<wave>As for you, your worksheet is filled with woe!<kgwait><br>Not a single one right! A big fat ZERO!</wave>",,,,
88,73,Teacher,"<wave>It looks like for you, math is a little less fun.<kgwait><br>For all of your answers, you only got one!</wave>",,,,
88,74,Teacher,<wave>Well isn't that interesting. A coincidence made!<kgwait><br>It seems that you both got the same grade!</wave>,,,,
88,75,Teacher,<wave>I've never seen such math! You clearly didn't rush!<kgwait><br>A perfect paper deserves a monstermon plush!</wave>,,,,
88,77,Austin,"Aw thanks, Ms. L!",,,,
88,78,Cindy,Ha!<kgwait> Suck it you brain-dead troll!,,,,
88,79,Alice,Whatever. I'm still not remembering what happened to me. There's gotta be something-,,,,
88,80,Cindy,Yeah. That's great. Don't care.,,,,
88,81,Cindy,"As for you, my darling husband, you can have this back.",,,,
88,82,Player,,,What is it?,,
88,83,Cindy,It's a drink dads like! I think it's called whiskey. My mom hides it from my dad and only gives it back to him if the lights stay on.,,,,
88,84,Alice,Whiskey?<kgwait> Why does that seem so-,,,,
88,85,Alice,<size=100>MR. SCIPPIO!!</size>,,,,
88,86,Alice,I remember! I spent lunch in his class! He had something important to tell me! I just don't remember what it was.,,,,
88,87,Austin,Well then we gotta go ask him!,,,,
88,88,Alice,,,,,
88,89,Cindy,Close enough. At least our daughter is the same kind of stupid as the other kids.,,,,
88,90,Cindy,What?! I thought that calculator was supposed to help!,,,,
88,91,Alice,"Wow. Even with a calculator, your daughter still is gonna get left back.",,,,
88,92,Cindy,Shut up! We'll get to the bottom of this!,,,,
88,93,Cindy,Be honest with me! Were you drunk the whole time you were helping with homework?,,,,
88,94,Player,,,Yes.,,
88,95,Player,,,No.,,
88,96,Cindy,"Well, jeez. Not even gonna sugar coat it for me? Fine. Take your stupid drink back. Apparently, hiding it isn't stopping you!",,,,
88,97,Cindy,Liar.,,,,
88,98,Player,,,Okay. Yes.,,
88,99,Teacher,<wave>That's the bell! It's time to munch!<kgwait><br>Please head on out to get some lunch!</wave>,,,,
88,100,Alice,Let's figure this out at lunch.,,,,
88,101,Cindy,"Oh, please. I'm not helping you.",,,,
88,102,Alice,Good thing I was only talking to people with brains in their heads.<kgwait> Let's get out of here.,,,,
88,103,Player,,,(Get out of here.),,
88,104,Alice,*Sigh*<kgwait> It's just not the same without Kevin.,,,,
88,105,Player,,,What's wrong?,,
88,106,Player,,,(Walk away.),,
88,107,Alice,"Oh, hey. <kgwait>It's just that I used to play house with Kevin, but he's missing. I feel like I know what happened to him, but I just can't remember.",,,,
88,108,Player,,,Bummer.,,
88,109,Alice,That thing is so horrible. Please get it away from me.,,,,
88,110,Player,,,I'm trying.,,
88,111,Alice,,,,,
88,112,Alice,Destroy that awful thing while it's down! Smash it to pieces!,,,,
88,113,Alice,Did it say it was gonna self-destruct?!<kgwait> I hate that thing so much! You gotta stop it!,,,,
88,114,Alice,"Thank goodness it's finally over-<kgwait> Hey, what's that noise?",,,,
88,115,Player,,,This thing.,,
88,116,Alice,"Well, if it's from that monstrous robot it's probably bad news. I would get rid of it.",,,,
88,117,Alice,*Ugh*<kgwait> This awful girl is gonna make playing house a total chore.<kgwait> Can you get her to play along?,,,,
88,118,Player,,,I'll try.,,
88,119,Alice,You should go pick up your daughter.<kgwait> Austin will be back any minute with my son.,,,,
88,120,Player,,,I'm on it.,,
88,121,Alice,I hate sharing with little brats. What's she even talking about? Something metal?,,,,
88,122,Player,,,Beats me.,,
89,0,Player,,,,,
89,1,Alice,,,,,
89,2,Alice,Hmmm...<kgwait> There doesn't seem to be anything out of the ordinary.,,,,
89,3,Player,,,What are you doing?,,
89,4,Player,,,(Walk away.),,
89,5,Alice,I'm trying to remember what happened to me on Monday. The last thing I remember is going down the slide.,,,,
89,6,Player,,,I think it goes underground.,,
89,7,Player,,,What happened on Monday?,,
89,8,Alice,The last thing I remember is going down the slide. The rest of the day is a blur.,,,,
89,9,Player,,,Interesting.,,
89,10,Alice,"Hey, do you think you could do me a favor? Can you go down the slide and see what happens?",,,,
89,11,Player,,,Sure.,,
89,12,Player,,,Why not you?,,
89,13,Player,,,Not a chance.,,
89,14,Alice,Ugh.<kgwait> Fine. I'll find someone who's not such a coward.,,,,
89,15,Player,,,You do that.,,
89,16,Alice,Cause the last time I went down this thing I woke up in a pool of goo! Now will you do it or not?,,,,
89,17,Alice,Awesome!<kgwait> I'll be waiting here for you to hopefully emerge.,,,,
89,18,Player,,,Hopefully?,,
89,19,Alice,Yeah! You'll be fine. Get going!,,,,
89,20,Player,,,(Get going.),,
89,21,Alice,We can do this. We can save Kevin even without Lily. Use that slide remote and let's go!,,,,
89,22,Player,,,I'm on it.,,
89,23,Alice,Ah!<kgwait> That's the bell!<kgwait> Hurry!<kgwait> Let's go!,,,,
89,24,Player,,,(Go.),,
89,25,Alice,Wow! That was crazy!<kgwait> I can't believe this whole day. This whole thing goes so deep!,,,,
89,26,Player,,,What do you mean?,,
89,27,Austin,"We were so worried!<kgwait> I tried to follow you guys down, but it didn't let me!",,,,
89,28,Alice,Yeah! It was crazy!<kgwait> There are tubes! And cages! And the principal is down ther-,,,,
89,29,Austin,,,,,
89,40,Alice,...Was. He was down there.,,,,
89,41,Austin,But do you remember what happened to you?,,,,
89,42,Alice,Yes!<kgwait> The slide scans kids for a certain gene that reacts to the green goo! Some kids can withstand it and it allows them to be transformed into monsters!,,,,
89,43,Lily,That's what I thought!<kgwait> That's why Billy was taken! He has the gene!,,,,
89,44,Alice,"Right! So do I!<kgwait> After we're exposed to goo and experience trauma, we transform into monsters!",,,,
89,45,Lily,So how did you get to the school you were at yesterday?,,,,
89,46,Alice,"There's a series of tunnels connecting the elementary schools in the area! It looked like a really old school, just underground!",,,,
89,47,Austin,What about Kevin?,,,,
89,48,Alice,He was gone before we got there.<kgwait> They must be taking him to another school in the area. We'll have to follow them tomorrow.,,,,
89,49,Austin,Good plan.<kgwait> I could use some rest after what happened today... <kgwait>And uh... <kgwait>Alice...<kgwait> I-<kgwait> I'm glad you're okay.,,,,
89,50,Alice,,,,,
89,51,Alice,We should also go home.<kgwait> Do you still have my decoder?,,,,
89,52,Player,,,Yeah.,,
89,53,Player,,,Nope.,,
89,54,Alice,Hmmm...<kgwait> I guess it's not much use to us now that the lab exploded.<kgwait> You can keep it if you want.,,,,
89,55,Player,,,I guess I will.,,
89,56,Lily,I'll contact Billy and let him know what we learned today. We'll formulate a plan for tomorrow.,,,,
89,57,Player,,,Sounds good.,,
89,58,Lily,Let's move out!,,,,
89,59,Player,,,(Move out.),,
89,60,Alice,Wait...<kgwait> Then how did you know the code to turn on the slide?,,,,
89,61,Player,,,Lucky guess?,,
89,62,Alice,"Riiiiiight.<kgwait> You know there's over 700 combinations, and you just happened to guess the right one?",,,,
89,63,Lily,He does always seem to know what I'll need for my plans. How do you do it?,,,,
89,64,Player,,,(Shrug.),,
89,65,Alice,"Hmmm...<kgwait> Whatever.<kgwait> I guess it worked out, but I'm watching you.",,,,
89,66,Lily,"Either way, we got a lot of good intel today. I'm gonna contact Billy and we'll come up with a plan to find Kevin tomorrow.",,,,
90,0,Player,,,,,
90,1,Davey,,,,,
90,2,Davey,"Hey, kid! Come over here.",,,,
90,3,Player,,,,,
90,4,Davey,That was not particularly wise.,,,,
90,5,Player,,,What do you mean?,,
90,6,Davey,Challenging Ms. Lovelett like that. She's gonna destroy you in a rap battle... <kgwait>unless.,,,,
90,7,Player,,,Unless what?,,
90,8,Davey,"Well...<kgwait>earlier this year, she went by MRS. Rhinehart.",,,,
90,9,Player,,,She changed her name?,,
90,10,Davey,"No!<kgwait> Well...<kgwait>yes, but you only go from MRS. to MS. if something happened to your husband.",,,,
90,11,Player,,,What happened?,,
90,12,Davey,"I don't know, but I do know that she keeps a diary. I think she keeps it hidden in here somewhere.",,,,
90,13,Player,,,Good to know.,,
90,14,Player,,,Why are you helping me?,,
90,15,Davey,You've only been listening to her rhyme for 5 minutes. I've been listening to it for months! That woman is so annoying!,,,,
90,16,Player,,,Thanks for your help.,,
90,17,Davey,Well?<kgwait> Did you get the fish?,,,,
90,18,Player,,,Yup.,,
90,19,Davey,Awesome! Thanks! Linda's gonna love him!<kgwait> A deal's a deal. Take the stupid crown.,,,,
90,20,Player,,,Thanks!,,
90,21,Player,,,Not yet.,,
90,22,Davey,Hehehe...<kgwait> Can't wait to feed you to Linda little fishy.,,,,
90,23,Player,,,(Walk away.),,
90,24,Davey,"Greetings, peasant!<kgwait> What business have ye with the King of the Playground?",,,,
90,25,Player,,,I need that crown.,,
90,26,Davey,Is that so?<kgwait> What offering haveth thee?,,,,
90,27,Player,,,What do you want?,,
90,28,Davey,Hmmmm...<kgwait> Perhaps I could part with my crown if you were to help me feed Linda.,,,,
90,29,Player,,,Feed Linda?,,
90,30,Davey,Yeah!<kgwait> She ate all the ducks around the school so I've been trying to find her other stuff to eat.<kgwait> The fish should do fine.,,,,
90,31,Player,,,You want me to steal the fish?,,
90,32,Davey,"Yeah! The fish for the crown! Hop to it, peasant!",,,,
90,33,Player,,,(Hop to it.),,
90,34,Player,,,King of the Playground?,,
90,35,Davey,Yeah! Every day one of us gets to wear the crown and be king!<kgwait> Whoever is king gets to decide which kids can ascend to the top of the playground!,,,,
90,36,Player,,,Interesting.,,
90,37,Davey,Aw shoot!<kgwait> The glass is blocking the axe still!<kgwait> We gotta find a way to break it!,,,,
90,38,Player,,,I'll see what I can do.,,
90,39,Davey,"Man, this thing is heavy!<kgwait> That wolf won't know what hit him!",,,,
90,40,Player,,,I think he will.,,
90,50,Davey,"Greetings, peasants! What business have ye with the King of the Playground?",,,,
90,51,Austin,"Hey, man.<kgwait> Can we not do the whole 'king' thing today? Alice finally asked me to play house with her and I want to do it right. Can I just have a doll?",,,,
90,52,Davey,Silence!<kgwait> You dare come to me for my treasures?!<kgwait> Only my loyal and trusted knights shall receive such boons!,,,,
90,53,Austin,"Ugh. What do you think, kid?<kgwait> I think we should. Y'know? For Alice? ",,,,
90,54,Player,,,I'll be a knight.,,
90,55,Player,,,Let's find another way.,,
90,56,Davey,Very well! I shall part with some of my treasures!<kgwait> Return to me at recess!,,,,
90,57,Player,,,"Yes, my liege.",,
90,58,Davey,Returneth to me at recess! Ye shall go on a noble quest for your king!,,,,
90,59,Player,,,"""Returneth?""",,
90,60,Player,,,"Yes, oh great king.",,
90,61,Davey,Get with the program or I'll be taking my treasure back.,,,,
90,62,Davey,"Oh, man. You're in for it now. Those robots mean business.",,,,
90,63,Player,,,Your dad wanted you to have this.,,
90,64,Player,,,What do you mean?,,
90,65,Player,,,Thanks for the vote of confidence.,,
90,66,Davey,I've seen these a few times floating around after school lets out when my dad was still around. They're really unpleasant.,,,,
90,67,Player,,,I figured.,,
90,68,Davey,What the-?!<kgwait> How did you get this? WHERE did you get this? You saw my dad?!,,,,
90,69,Player,,,He said you'd know what it means.,,
90,70,Davey,"Yeah, I guess I do.<kgwait> I don't think it's gonna save you from getting shot in the face now, but thanks.",,,,
90,71,Player,,,You're welcome.,,
90,72,Davey,Wow.<kgwait> I can't believe you knocked that thing down. I've never seen one so vulnerable.,,,,
90,73,Player,,,He said you'd know what it means.,,
90,74,Davey,Yeah. I do.<kgwait> I guess I better help you out.,,,,
90,75,Player,,,Really?,,
90,76,Davey,"Yeah. This duck changes everything, but after we get outta here, you gotta take me to my dad.",,,,
90,77,Player,,,Deal.,,
90,78,Davey,"DIE, BAD ROBOT!!!",,,,
90,79,PlayerCharacter,,,,,
90,80,Player,,,Go me.,,
90,81,Davey,You need to find a way to stop that thing from blowing up. I've done everything I can think of.,,,,
90,82,Player,,,And you did it wonderfully.,,
90,83,Davey,,,,,
90,84,Player,,,What do I do with this?,,
90,85,Davey,Oh! That's one of my dad's power cores! I remember he said something about them. Um... they explode if they aren't actively powering something.,,,,
90,86,Player,,,That's not great.,,
90,87,Davey,"And with the robot destroyed, I don't know if there's anything in here you can plug it into.",,,,
90,88,Player,,,I'll find something.,,
90,89,Davey,I can't believe you did it. Those robots have always scared me.,,,,
90,90,Player,,,Yay me.,,
90,91,Davey,I'm gonna go see if I can get Linda to come back. Come meet me before the bell rings again.,,,,
90,92,Player,,,You got it.,,
90,93,Davey,Well?<kgwait> Hast thou changedth thou's mind? Will thou be knights?,,,,
91,0,Player,,,,,
91,1,Davey,,,,,
91,2,Davey,"Halt, peasant! The King of the Playground is not taking appointments with his subjects at this hour. Begone!",,,,
91,3,Player,,,King?,,
91,5,Player,,,(Begone.),,
91,6,Davey,"I am the King of the Playground!<kgwait> You can tell by my shiny crown.<kgwait> Now begone, peasant!",,,,
91,7,Davey,Well?<kgwait> Did you cut the blue wire? Will the axe still be there?,,,,
91,8,Player,,,You bet!,,
91,9,Player,,,It will not.,,
91,10,Davey,Awesome!<kgwait> Now we just have to get the axe out of your old teacher.<kgwait> We'll have to do it together. I couldn't get it out by myself earlier.,,,,
91,11,Player,,,So what do we do?,,
91,12,Davey,We need to both get inside and get to the office.,,,,
91,13,Player,,,How do we do that?,,
91,14,Davey,Hmmm... <kgwait>We'll have to distract the teacher.,,,,
91,15,Player,,,I'll figure something out.,,
91,16,Davey,Just look at them over there.<kgwait> Cruel jerks!,,,,
91,17,Player,,,What are you talking about?,,
91,18,Davey,Austin seems to have aligned himself with that nasty janitor!<kgwait> I can't believe this betrayal!,,,,
91,19,Player,,,You should stop him.,,
91,20,Davey,"Yeah! I may not be able to stop that janitor, but I can at least be really annoying to his helper!",,,,
91,21,Player,,,Go get 'em!,,
91,22,Davey,<size=100>FOR LINDAAAAAAA!!!</size>,,,,
91,23,Davey,,,,,
91,24,Player,,,I'm not interested.,,
91,25,Player,,,"Yeah, that stinks. Bye!",,
91,26,Davey,Austin!<kgwait> What are you doing?!<kgwait> How could you betray Linda like this?!<kgwait> She was the flower girl at your sister's wedding!,,,,
91,27,Austin,"I know, man. I'm sorry.<kgwait> This creepy old weirdo is making me do it and I'm more scared of him than most of the other stuff around here.",,,,
91,28,Janitor,Let's not be hurtful.,,,,
91,29,Davey,High treason!<kgwait> How dare you?!,,,,
91,30,Davey,,,,,

91,37,Davey,I can't believe you would do this!<kgwait> You deserve to be Linda food!,,,,
91,38,Austin,I don't wanna do this!<kgwait> But I also don't wanna end up in that support group the kids from the other school are in!,,,,
91,39,Player,,,(Let them fight it out.),,

91,67,Player,,,Any ideas?,,
91,68,Player,,,I'll think of something.,,
91,69,Davey,"Well...<kgwait> Austin wasted no time taking over the fort. He's probably gonna try and break that window, but if he hits the bird he's a dead man.",,,,

95,13,Player,,,I'll see if I can find it.,,
95,16,Teacher,<wave>I'm looking for a classic. I'm stuck just because...<kgwait><br>I can't find the school copy of Wizard of Oz!,,,,

119,85,Janitor,"Yeah, it's one of those 'takes one to know one' things. ",,,,
119,86,Janitor,"I'm a janitor, not a languager!",,,,
119,87,Player,,,How do we kill her?,,
119,88,Janitor,Same way I kill anything around here! With my mop! Only problem is the damn reptile broke it this morning. I need a new one from the armory.,,,,

119,101,Player,,,So what do I do?,,
119,102,Janitor,Just go into the bathroom and ask him where he keeps his spare. I'll be in the office taking care of business.,,,,
119,103,Player,,,"Have a good day at work, Dad.",,

119,108,Janitor,"Okay, fine.<kgwait> This is the SECOND most ridiculous thing. ",,,,
119,109,Janitor,I can't get into my closet with the key we got earlier. It must be for something else.,,,,
119,110,Player,,,So why are we here?,,
119,111,Janitor,Apparently the teacher who used to be in this classroom got promoted to janitor yesterday. New boss said he should have a key.,,,,
119,112,Player,,,And the door is locked.,,
119,113,Janitor,Bingo.<kgwait> I'm gonna keep banging on this door.<kgwait> Why don't you see if there's another way inside.,,,,

119,126,Janitor,"Jeez, Ms. Bazongadongas... <kgwait>*huff*<kgwait> I always knew you'd be hefty if I had to dispose of you, but this is a little *huff*<kgwait> egregious.",,,,
119,127,Janitor,"Well, well, well!<kgwait> Look who it is!<kgwait> A couple of Linda lovers!<kgwait> Hope you've said goodbye to the giant gecko cause she's gonna look like ole Applegate here when I'm done with her!",,,,
119,128,Davey,"We're gonna save Linda! Just you watch!<kgwait> C'mon, kid! Let's get back to lunch.",,,,
119,129,Player,,,Right behind you.,,
119,130,Janitor,*huff*<kgwait> Just a little further.<kgwait>*huff*<kgwait>Aw you're bleeding everywhere...<kgwait> Great.<kgwait> More work for the ole janitor.,,,,
119,131,Player,,,(Let him drag the body.),,
119,132,Janitor,I knew she'd have a lot of blood in her... <kgwait>but this is a lot even for me.,,,,
119,133,Janitor,,,,,
119,134,Player,,,Did you even do anything?,,
119,135,Janitor,Okay!<kgwait> This will make a fine war room!<kgwait> We gotta come up with a plan to take down our enemy!,,,,

119,147,Janitor,He just ran out!<kgwait> Stole the key to the front door and said I couldn't catch him!,,,,
119,148,Player,,,He was right.,,
119,149,Janitor,That doesn't mean it wasn't rude.,,,,
119,150,Player,,,Okay then.,,

119,154,Janitor,"I would, but it reminds me too much of the war.",,,,
119,155,Player,,,How?,,
119,156,Player,,,I don't even wanna know.,,
